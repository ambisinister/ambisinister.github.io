			<h1>Monthly Links</h1>

			<p> This page is mostly a log in which I keep links to things I've read, made, done, etc. It's separated by month, along with my goals for the next month, and should be end up being in reverse chronological order (i.e. with the most recent month at the very top). The formatting might not be super great because I export these from evernote and just paste them in, but for the most part this page exists just to keep me accountable for how much I accomplish from month-to-month. </p>

			<h2 id="2018">2018</h2>

				<h2 id="february">February</h2>

					<h3 id="goalsformarch">Goals for March</h3>

					<ul>
					<li>Finish Bracket Stamina project and Spaced repetition post; finish reading Proofs and Refutations; make anki cards on US History; Start working through Linear Algebra Done Right and <a href="http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/anjp/textbook.pdf">this</a>.</li>

					<li>SSBM: continue working on implementing aerial drift, specifically out of short hop; work on making platform punishes against fastfallers more consistent</li>

					<li>Practice some substantial amount of time this month learning to play guitar, figure out some way to track hours practiced (for this and for other things)</li>

					<li>Maintain your reading habits but focus primarily on math / guitar / SSBM / writing</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Health
							<li>finished a two month trial period for <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/bacopa-monnieri/">Bacopa Monnieri</a>. Ended up observing a rise in correct answers for new + young anki cards of about 8%, and no change in mature cards. I didn't do any blinding, and would probably have to revisit this if I wanted to explore it deeply in any capacity. I don't really feel like bacopa gave me anything super valuable given the magnitude of the effect, so I've discontinued taking it (although I might consider taking it again if I ever decide to become a student again). Funny to think about how effectively you can replace the use of short term memory with good external capturing like anki or Evernote.</li>
						</li>
						<li>SSBM
							<li>spent virtually my entire month practicing backwards aerial drift. Entered a tournament and placed pretty well despite feeling pretty off tech-skill wise. Feel good about practice paying off somewhat for me.</li>
						</li>
						<li>Misc
							<li>Decided against adding an RSS feed, since adding one for a static website is more trouble than it's worth and I have a far too small readership that would ever use it.</li>
							<li>Met most of my goals from last month (only finished 2 books but did a lot of reading), still need some calibration but enough of my time went towards practicing melee that I had a slightly below average level of productivity</li>
						</li>

					<p><a href="http://oracleselixir.com/2015/10/egr-and-mlr-new-team-ratings/">EGR AND MLR: NEW TEAM RATINGS</a>
					Shown to me by Shi Deng of Big Blue esports. A pretty interesting look at how different teams perform at different stages of a match in league of legends; sadly I'm not much of a league player so the nuances of choosing 15 minutes as a threshold / the importance of dragons vs gold / etc are lost on me, but the analysis strategy is pretty interesting and I enjoyed reading it. (Also reminded me that I need to learn to implement k-fold cross validation)</p>

					<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05866.pdf">A Brief Survey of Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>
					Pretty cool survey paper. Got a kick out of "We begin our survey of value-function-based DRL algorithms with the DQN [84], pictured in Figure 5, which achieved scores across a wide range of classic Atari 2600 video games [10] that were comparable to that of a professional video games tester." (what does this even mean?)</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/2016-levitt.pdf">HEADS OR TAILS: THE IMPACT OF A COIN TOSS ON MAJOR LIFE DECISIONS AND SUBSEQUENT HAPPINESS</a>
					People who make changes report being much happier 2-6 months later, even when the choice to make that decision was completely random. "The results of this paper suggest that people may be excessively cautious when facing life changing choices".</p>

					<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091026234156/http://geocities.com/currintrading/">Currin Trading - Ambition, Deception, Honor, Redemption: The story of the biggest heist in Eve's history</a>
					Half chilling, half fascinating - Eve Online scammer details how he ran a ponzi scheme disguised as a fraudulent trading corporation in-game, eventually leading to him making away with 30 billion isk (A few thousand dollars). There's a lot of really amusing anecdotes in here (he claims he didn't sell the isk for real money because he didn't want to break the terms of service, he mentions the playerbase revolting after the moderators returned money from a different scam, and that he had intended to return as much of it as possible before being mistakenly banned and changing his mind upon the reversal), and it reads like a wild criminal testimonial for someone who knows he's not going to face any repercussions. In the end he blew the whistle on another scammer, the EVE Interstellar Bank, a scam that netted <em>that</em> scammer 750 billion isk (~$80k USD). </p>

					<p>"those who did not make specific requests, and instead asked open-ended questions like "how can I trust you?" and "how do I know this is for real?"--these were future investors. They were asking me to persuade them. They wanted to believe."</p>

					<p>"People who posted on the forums seemed to have a negative attitude about everything. Rather than being a cross-section of the Eve populace, the forums were populated by a group disparagingly known as "the forum superstars"--people who spent all their time on the forums instead of actually playing the game. Not only did they have a fame and influence far out of proportion to their playing abilities, they were accused of getting special treatment from the administrators of the Eve servers. But it was their persistent scorn for anyone making anything new--and their seeming inability to make their own positive contributions to the game--that maintained the ordinary players' low regard for them."</p>

					<p>"In the end, I decided that the only value in having stolen all of that isk was not the isk itself, but the stealing of it. I wanted to see if I could do the impossible, and I did it. The more I pondered the actual value of isk, the more I saw that the only people who really valued it were the ones who had earned it themselves. Despite Eve being a game, they had put real work into it. Many of them had spent three years shooting rocks and hauling modules around to earn that isk, and now it would be gone."</p>

					<p>"Only now did I appreciate just how insidious a scam could be. I had thought the isk meant nothing to me. That it was just a means to an end, a score to beat. But now I was willing to wreak devastation upon all of my investors just to hold onto it. The scam had scammed me. It stole my concern for others and replaced it with gluttony. I was disgusted. I lied. I cheated people. I used people to help me scam their friends. I was the cause of widespread bankruptcy. But the most damning thing of all? I think I can live with it, and if I had it to do all over again, I would. To my surprise, a guilty conscience was a small price to pay for thirty billion isk. So I will learn to live with it, because I can live with it."</p>

				<h2 id="january">January</h3>

					<h3 id="goalsforfebruary">Goals for February</h3>

					<ul>
					<li>SSBM: use solo practice time better, do a lot of set analysis / notetaking especially vs marth and sheik, work on implementing better control over aerial drift</li>

					<li>Site: make site more mobile friendly, write scripts to manage a bunch of pages at once</li>

					<li>Write one article, make one video, read four books</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>

					<ul>
					<li>Tentatively added Disqus comments to my writings - fully prepared to reevaluate this later and conclude it was a bad idea but I've been meaning to have a means of people sharing their ideas with me without needing to contact me on social media so this seems like a worthy try</li>

					<li>also added google analytics, which I did not do before my statistics post and kicked myself for - it'll be useful to check what kind of audience I have for everything</li>

					<li>Couldn't think of use for Raspberry Pi, Didn't get around to adding RSS, met all other goals for month and completed four books (!)</li>

					<p><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ambistats.html">Making Sense of Melee: The Illusion of Objective Ranks and the Real Impact of Everything</a>
					The culmination of my most recent long-term Melee Stats project where I gathered tons of tournament sets and examined trends in the data - I used this data for seeding and for my SSBMRank Ballot, and this post details my further scrutinizing of the patterns within. The post got a lot more attention than I was expecting! (It got something like 56k views if my rough, then-poor analytics are to be trusted). Somebody posted it to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16255910">Hacker News</a> where it ended up reaching #6, and it got tons of shares on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/957830089110147072">Twitter</a>. I was very pleased that people were so excited about it, and ended up in a surreal daze after seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/958125156525858816">Gwern</a> make a tweet about Claude Bloodgood the same day. </p>

					KayB is a Melee Stats denizen, and he wrote a post exploring the supposed "West Coast Bias" in the SSBMRank panel.

					A surprisingly optimistic paper which suggests that most people are actually impressively resilient after aversive events. Because so many people that show up to clinicians after bad things happen are in need of clinicians to help them, the prevailing view was that when bad things happen to people they usually need time to grieve. However, the sample size was very self-selecting here, and exploring more "normal" baselines suggest its possible that on average people are pretty good about staying functional through traumatic events. </p>

				An incredible, hilarious paper that I plan on linking people frequently in the future - from the abstract: <em>"However, if research results are selectively chosen, a review has the potential to create a convincing argument for a faulty hypothesis.

I really appreciated the structure and despite it being a little wonky at first it made the rest of the guide pretty simple to understand since everything made some sense from a Japanese-speaking perspective rather than an English-speaking one imposed upon the Japanese language.

I had fun with it, but I couldn't manage to 100% it because there were just some stars that were so broken that I got too frustrated to continue playing.

				<p><em><a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf">Example of the Glicko-2 System</a></em> 
				I ran this on a database of 22k super smash brothers melee tournament set results, after ELO gave me mediocre results. The results were better than ELO but still not very good.</p>

				I'm not crazy about Malcolm Gladwell but this video I think is a really well-worded depiction of learning skills in general. I've watched a bunch of Adam Neely's videos and he strikes me as extremely well-read, I was impressed by how interesting all of his videos were while still consistently being about music each time.</p>

				Watched this after playing a set at Shine 2017 against a luigi and realizing that I didn't have a firm understanding of my goals in this matchup (shine doesn't lead to anything, grab doesn't lead to anything, so what are you going for in neutral against luigi? What's your gameplan? I ended up just going for random hits and getting steamrolled). Takeaways: uptilt vs nairs, dash attack is a common mixup situation (nair out jump out etc), usually avoid midrange (close/far is good), Disjoints are good (uptilt, falling upair). Being above luigi is very good. Empty drill into fullhop is pretty good because you can punish grab attempts with falling upair. </p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uO1XE2MSnc">A YouTube choir: the history of the most viewed videos converted into sound</a></em>
				Perfect blend of Music, Math, Visualization, and Shitposting. I got a huge kick out of the inclusion of "All I Want For Christmas Is You" which predictably shot up every december and then didn't move for the rest of the year.</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChPO9yPOy8c">"Rewrite" Production Vlog #6: Everything is Fucked Up</a></em>
				This is one of those "Truth is stranger than fiction" type of stories I struggle to wrap my head around, and yet I actually believe. tl;dr these two are shooting a documentary about a now-shut-down modded video game, and got in contact with a reclusive developer "Magus" who moves into their apartment to help them with the documentary. However, it turns out that the person that claimed to be Magus was actually somebody impersonating Magus, having done so for months and knowing intimate information that "verified" their identity with other dev team members. Nobody knows who this person was, or how they knew so much about Magus and the internal details of the development team, and everybody is freaked out about it.</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeItHAxLg9w">Batman: The Dark Knight Trilogy Cover - Pedrosaxo</a></em> Guy plays a duet with himself, seems very technically demanding. I don't play saxophone but what I'm vaguely sure is going on here is he's using the same technique you use for circular breathing in order to hum a note at the same time he produces a note on his instrument, resulting in two notes being played. Very neat!</p>

				</ul>

				<h3>Things I've made</h3>

				<h4>Writing:</h4>

				<p><em><a href="./articles/health.html">Optimizing health with cronometer</a></em>
				I hit my weight goal, going to start resistance training next</p>

				<p><em><a href="./articles/omron.html">How variable are Omron Scales</a></em>
				Since I met my weight goal I tested the variability of my scale a second time. If I gain weight in a substantially lean way and get my old values for bodyfat, I'll conclude that the scales results are useless. Otherwise, I'll measure what it returns.</p>

				<h4>Blogposts, Web</h4>

				<p><em>OpenAI Dota 2 AI</em> <a href="https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/">[1]</a> <a href="https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/">[2]</a>
				Not good enough at dota to make an accurate assessment. Compare to Vlad "Xpilot" Firoiu's <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/108984/986497700-MIT.pdf?sequence=1">master's thesis at MIT</a> Philip the Falcon Ditto AI, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXJUlqBsZtE">can beat good players</a>; as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qWHM8DNdr8">SmashBot</a>, which uses a hardcoded goals hierarchy rather than learning it all via deep reinforcement learning.  These fall under what I call "Watson Syndrome" where they are capable of winning because of their superior "biology" rather than actually outplaying their opponents, and as such I don't think these are particularly useful as training tools (I.e. A "winning position" for the AI is not necessarily winning for a human, if such a situation requires something like frame perfect reaction time, and attempting to emulate its playstyle would likely be extremely foolish, unlike with Deep Blue or AlphaGo. For games with a biological element [Melee, Dota, Jeopardy] emulating realistic biology is important before you can announce "triumph" over human players.)</p>

				<p><em><a href="http://www.genetickanji.com/grade1.asp">Genetickanji - Kanji Grade 1</a></em>
				I've been doing five of these each day and have gone through a little over 100 this month - I specifically wanted something reasonably structured by radical / Mnemonic but with actual readings (which RTK did not have - I have a copy of it and I'm using it for kanji I'm having trouble with but as a method by itself it seems pretty terrible). Some of the suggestions for remembering things in genetickanji are bad / big stretches, but overall it's nicely structured and not too big a commitment to figure out.</p>

				I bet $10 with @uconnsdoom that UCF is not present at Big House 7, Summit, Genesis, CEO, or EVO.</p>

				<h4>Papers</h4>

				<p><em><a href="https://makegirlsmoe.github.io/assets/pdf/technical_report.pdf">Create Anime Characters With A.I.! (Jin et al 2017)</a></em>
				amazing / hilarious / surprisingly straightforward, particularly enjoyed the section on generating release-date-specific images ("as you can see from figure 5... the more recent images are cuter and higher quality")</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28742910/">Clinicopathological Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in Players of American Football (Mez et al 2017)</a></em>
				Football is a moral evil and inherently dangerous (half kidding). A somewhat self-selecting sample, but the effect size is so large that this could be considered a huge blow to the idea that "football is safe enough for children".</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.06643.pdf">Predicting Personality from Book Preferences with User-Generated Content Labels (Annalyn et al 2017)</a></em>
				A cool paper exploring differences in personality among people who enjoy certain genres of books, using user-submitted tags on goodreads and declared preferences on facebook. The visualization in this paper is excellent, and although I don't think the paper's conclusion is that powerful (correlation between a preference + big 5 feels pretty unimportant) I think the methodology was great.</p>

				<h4>Books / Audiobooks</h4>

				<p><em>Berlitz Complete Japanese</em>
				A good series of dialogues to introduce basic Japanese grammar (I'm still very much a beginner but I imagine this is all N5 level). The dialogues are charming enough to keep you reasonably engaged - I found myself more amused than I ought to be listening to Harrison-san's antics, which I think is a good thing for this type of resource. The dialogues are completely in Japanese, which is what I wanted, but things become confusing if you can't figure out what words mean so this might be worth supplementing with another textbook, a dictionary, or the workbook. There's some weirdness (pronouncing wo particle actually as "wo" sometimes) but overall good to listen to if you want to practice listening/speaking</p>

				<p><em>Introductory Statistics with R</em>
				A book that I think is best suited either with a teacher or with another, more traditional, statistics textbook. Using R has proven very useful, but the book was heavy with jargon that it did not explain properly, and I frequently felt lost despite making flashcards and reading very carefully. Certain concepts are vaguely explained or not explained at all, and you're expected to have a minimum level of knowledge that I felt was inappropriate given that it also explained really basic stuff like factorials. Overall a useful book that added a good tool to my toolkit, but one that frequently had me googling things for clarification.</p>

				<h4>Manga</h4>

				<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria_(manga)">Aria</a></em>
				Slow, relaxing, with some basic scifi concepts, works better as a manga than an anime due to pacing. Fits the genre of "utopia that isn't a utopia", everyone just sort of lazily goes about their days and most of the story is literally about being able to slow down and admire the scenery around you (MC's entire personality type, as well as the job of the Primas). </p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.gwern.net/Aria%27s%20past,%20present,%20and%20future">Aria's Past, Present, and Future (Gwern)</a></em>
				Hilarious, I've always had a soft spot for violating suspension of disbelief and then trying to explain it away using crazy theories. Reminds me a lot of the "<a href="http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Matrix_in_a_Matrix_theory">Matrix in a Matrix</a>" theory, where people plugged the ridiculous left-field plot hole of Matrix Reloaded as evidence that, since Neo can use powers in the "real world", it's likely not the real world - just another layer of fabrication that Neo pulled his punches in because he didn't believe he had powers in there. Probably false, but a fun way to engage with plot holes!</p>

				<h4>Anime</h4>

				<p><em>Koe no Katachi (2016)</em> - I think as good of a film adaptation as I could have reasonably expected from condensing this rather long story into a two hour film. Pacing issues that were not present in the manga, parts felt extremely rushed due to cutting out some smaller arcs to make time. Characters didn't have enough time to properly develop into believable characters with the exception of the main character, again a byproduct of lack of time. Where this film shines is sound direction, it uses silence and white noise extremely well, which compliments the films themes (hearing vs listening / blocking out the world / etc). The animation is fantastic as well, Kyoto Animation delivers as you might expect. Overall not quite as good as the manga adaptation, but not bad by any means.</p>
