Domain experts from random fields can be good collab / problem-generation sources. Make sure your problem statement is super crystal clear <i>and</i> falsifiable. Synthetic data is garbage for many reasons, but ultimately because data people care about is very important. Simplicity is strength for a researcher, a paper implicitly says "this is the easiest way to get results this good". Look to other fields for solutions! (see: Range). Discussions on Durer's rhino / refuting literature. Make sure your problem actually exists. The first page of a paper and the Anchoring effect. Reproducibility is important. Define Acronyms Before They Are Used. Use all the space.

Learn before you memorize. Build upon basics. Make cards as simple as possible. Cloze deletions are good (core of incremental reading). Use pictures. Use mnemonics (but only really with like 1-5% of your cards). Graphic deletion is good. Avoid sets or enumerations of items (atomize). Minimize interference. Optimize wording. Refer to other memories. Personalize / use examples. Rely on emotional states. context clues to simplify wording. Redundancy isn't so bad. Provide sources. Provide date stamping. Prioritize.

A good measurable goal for this would be a 60 seconds frogstand.

<li><b>Continue doing high volume of pullups</b> I might have to get off of armstrong since the thursday and monday volumes usually leave me way too fatigued the next day and I feel like I would get tendonitis on this program eventually, but continuing a high volume of pullups in pursuit of the 20 rep set remains a goal of mine before progressing towards OAC variations.

Turns out, they sorta do! Certain of these cells are more optimistic or pessimistic, and together from the ensemble you can reconstruct a pretty good representation of the ground truth reward distribution. Interesting to think of the implications of overweighing optimistic vs pessimistic dopamine cells.

The fact that this can be recoupled in a non-invasive way to relatively lasting effects is kind of nuts.

<li><a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/14/859">How does exercise treatment compare with antihypertensive medications?</a> Meta-analysis suggests exercise is pretty comparable to drug intervention on this front, although the broad categories of "exercise" or even stuff like "resistance training" is highly variable depending on the subject. That said, the comparison is tricky because most people who exercise in these studies have pretty decent blood pressure at baseline, and restricting to only patients who would be labeled as hypertensive seems to suggest a greater chance for improvement there.

However, I think that <i>concerns</i> about this sort of attack are somewhat overblown (and are mostly demonstrations on how brittle deep networks are) since I think there are more likely causes for misclassification than adversarial attacks which often rely on access to the model to generate patches anyways (e.g. stop signs which are defaced or at unusual angles, people of poorly represented ethnicities in the training data, etc)

The authors claim that human "start-up software" make human performance benchmarks nebulous, and identify a number of conceptual elements which could be targeted to make AI think and learn more like humans: intuitive physics and psychology, compositionality, learning-to-learn, and fast/efficient real-time learning and thinking. Main article claims constraints based on biological plausibility are putting the cart before the horse, since our understanding of these biological systems are, themselves, cartoon representations of their actual functionality, and subject to change as we gain more understanding of them. Peer commentary was a refreshing component of this, and was categorized by the authors into three axes: nature vs nurture, symbolic vs sub-symbolic, and coherent theories vs theory fragments. Some of the more common specific components on this front were concerns of embodiment, social cognition (i.e. learning from other agents, or a culture), and intrinsic motivation. Definitely a very good read, and led me to a number of other cool papers.

<h4 id="sec-1-2-1-5">Reflections</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1-5">
<p>
I don't think it would surprise anybody to hear that I consider 2019 to be, probably, my most successful year ever. The most exciting thing to me about this year was that it blew the door open for my personal development, and I can see so much space in front of me to continue to grow. At the end of last year, my number one goal was <i>Dramatically restructure my life to spend higher percentage of time doing things I find interesting instead of just a few hours a day</i>, and at the risk of sounding too much like I'm bragging, I think I can safely say that I crushed this goal. I finally feel like I'm doing something I'm well-suited for, and while stuff like motivation waxes and wanes, the amount of time I actually get to dedicate towards genuinely fascinating things is so much higher than it has ever been. I don't feel reliant on feeling especially motivated to do things, which may have somewhat harmed my motivation levels but vastly improved my output. 
</p>

<p>
That said, an extremely large share of this output is now taking place outside this website, which detracted somewhat from the second goal I had this year (i.e. 15 projects, 4-5 being big ones with longform writing piece attached). I was able to put out <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/personainsmash.html">Predicting Personality with Playstyle in Super Smash Brothers</a> which even now I'm shocked I was able to complete in such a short timeframe (8 days). However, 2019 was largely characterized by a sort of academic <a href="https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Power_leveling">powerleveling</a> in my life, with comparatively little interesting output (at least public-facing). I feel good about my progress (getting spun up on deep learning from the ground up, working through probmods, reading literally hundreds of papers) but now that I'm more settled into my new lifestyle I'm hoping that I can put a greater focus on making cool things. 
</p>

<p>
I was unable to read 20 books, but given that so much of my time was spent reading I am just going to count this as a successful goal anyways (going through probmods alone involved reading close to 60 papers alongside the textbook, with exercises, and only incremented this counter by 1). 
</p>

<p>
I feel good about my fitness progress in 2019, as well, although perhaps not relative to the amount of time I put into them this year. I went from ~V2+/V3- to ~V3+/V4- at climbing, which was not quite as much progress as I would've liked but was good progress nonetheless. My weight training was up and down, largely influenced by my dramatic lifestyle changes this year, but the important thing is that I'm back on the grind and I'm stronger than I've ever been. I'm definitely not there yet, but I made some progress and I'm happy with that. 
</p>

<p>
2020 goals:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>1/2/3/4 plate compound lifts</b> This should put me just past intermediate for most lifts, unless my weight dramatically changes
</li>
<li><b>Climb V6</b> Figure this will be a nice counterbalance to ensure my weight doesn't get out of control
</li>
<li><b>Get published</b> 
</li>
<li><b>Read at least 4 textbooks, across at least 2 fields</b>
</li>
<li><b>Read 15 books</b>
</li>
<li><b>Post at least 5 longform writing pieces on this website</b>
</li>
<li><b>Fully optimize lifestyle around happiness</b>

<li><b>Started lifting weights again</b> honestly fairly irritated that I pulled myself away from weights this long, considering how nice it feels to do these workouts.

<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTV7-FpkN-Su_LDgfy5LIl0DZOjv1AQM/view">The Vertical Jump Bible 2.0</a> building off the idea of periodization, wanted to do some research into generic lower body power routines since most of the climbing literature talks primarily about upper body power. My big takeaways here are that for a good vertical jump there are three general locuses of training: one - getting to 1.5x bodyweight barbell squat and low bodyfat percentage; two - if your standing vertical is less than your depth jump, you should work on power; three - if your depth jump is better than your standing vertical, you should work on strength. There's lots of routines in this book I might revisit when I work on power but the two takeaways for me are that I should probably add power cleans and depth jumps / pylometrics to that part of my periodization (if I care about it)

I tried some deep dish pizza and it was okay, definitely quite a bit less good compared to New Haven / New York / Most other good pizza I've eaten in my life.

<li><b>Research thoughts</b> this month I've been grappling with the fact that research involves trying to unearth things which are not known to have answers already, and therefore there are no promises about whether your idea will actually work or not. I think this is a really important part of the process, even though it feels not-so-nice when your beautiful idea doesn't pan out. Confronting your failures in this way, I think, is a very important part of being a researcher, and I'm learning that it's important to view the chance to explore an idea as a fun thing for its own sake, independent of the idea solving your problem outright.

<li><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/faculty/activity/_fulltext/schwartz-michael-2003-2003michiganstatedcllawreview447.pdf">Teaching Law Students to be Self-Regulated Learners</a> Mirrors some of my frustrations, both with the attitude of teachers and the attitude of learners towards teachers, which I consider to be extremely poor particularly in the United States. "When given appropriate instruction, nearly all law students can achieve mastery &#x2013; not minimum competence, but mastery &#x2013; of the skills of the novice lawyer." Setting goals and monitoring self-efficacy can <b>boost achievement by 30 percent</b> and, critically, this is not an innate thing, you can teach it and learn it and just reap this 30% boost. Self-Regulated / Expert learning involves three phases which abstractly can be thought of as the scientific method applied to academic tasks &#x2013; <i>forethought, performance, and reflection</i>, a large portion of which is oriented towards calibrating awareness of not knowing something, and being able to comprehend how you would turn yourself into someone who <i>does</i> know that thing. Teaching students to approach their own learning in this fashion generally makes things happier and easier for everyobdy involved, since the students will be able to assess where/why they don't understand something and prevent the teacher from having to dig around to find this out. Really interesting to see where this entirely practical perspective intersects with the psychology literature on this topic. "[Those with] mastery goals are more likely to ask themselves how they can accomplish their goals and what they will learn (and usually select tasks based on the learning value of those tasks) whereas those with performance goals are more likely to ask whether they can do the task and whether they will look smart (and usually select tasks based on their ease)." .

The level design is great, it expects so much from the player and in turn feels like you've actually achieved something meaningful every time you complete an obstacle. Obstacles designed to be passed using wavedashing is something I didn't expect to experience in canon, but the team behind Celeste goes above and beyond here, adding rooms <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZeBtF7bPAE">specifically designed for skilled play</a>. I honestly could rant about Celeste for hours (which I have <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/celeste.html">have done before</a>), but all I will say about farewell is that it's supposed to serve as a goodbye, but it instead completely reignited my interest in the game and I've been on a quest to collect all the goldens (currently at 191/202).

(Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer 1989)</a> Nobody ever mentions statistical power alongside significance, with median power as low as .25 often being used as confirmation of the null hypothesis. Standard statistical practice (which I read about in <i>Introductory Statistics with R</i> and apparently comes from Cohen 1965) fixes power at .80 and alpha at .05 before calculating n, but much research just tries to collect some <i>n</i> first, and Cohen found that for medium effect sizes the median experiment had a 50% chance of finding a significant effect <i>in cases where there was a true effect</i>. 24 years later, in a meta review, it turns out nobody listened to Cohen, and power is still ignored. "Obviously the important thing&#x2026; is to have a low real error, not to have a 'significant' result at a particular station. The latter seems to me to be nearly valueless in itself" -Gosset, 1908

I think this paper is written at an undergraduate level, and contains only one equation in it (that being bayes theorem). Probabilistic models and causal bayes nets as potential answers to the inverse problem, which allows you to <i>actually figure out</i> the highest-probability explanation for a set of evidence (i.e. a set of symptoms for a list of diseases). Some evidence that children learn in a way roughly approximable by probabilistic models (I wish I remembered more from my undergrad developmental psych class!). <i>Bayesian Pedagogical Models</i> formalize a thought I remember having in an intro psychology course - children assume different probabilistic models if they assume the person they are interacting with are trying to teach them something (i.e. they assume that the input is informative in some way). might be worth going back later if I ever need to refresh on some relevant developmental psychology vis-a-vis probabilistic modeling, which I was vaguely familiar with and didn't flashcard since I don't work much with children.

These kids papers are always great when they include quotes. "E: What if I told you there was a number after a million and ninety nine? A million one hundred."

<li><a href="http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/predictions.pdf">Optimal Predictions in Everyday Cognition</a> alluded to in How to grow a Mind; when given a vague question like "if you meet someone that is 60 years old, how much longer will they live" people seem to naturally gravitate towards the right distributions (i.e. gaussians for lifespans, power law distributions for box office grossing, etc) for their predictions. Amusing that they had to dump out the marriage question because 52% of the respondents said the marriages would last forever, roughly equal to the proportion of non-divorced marriages, but couldn't average "forever" with anything to get an accurate median. Uncovering this sort of distribution with aggregate intuition is probably why prediction markets are usually pretty effective predictors despite only some proportion of the predictors being "superforecasters"

This methodology can't be used, you can't assume the prior (+ it could just be different). Tauber and Steyvers use an integrative approach to infer if the environmental prior was normal, erlang, or pareto distributed, and were able to mostly faithfully reproduce GT 2006 along with infer a new distribution around the fantasy age question despite no environmental data to fit it with.

I think that where this errs is that it tries to ascribe agency to any particular part of the system, rather than to the entire system, <i>even though they are not isomorphic</i>, which is the key thing missing from his commentary. An equivalent question would be something like "imagine you are a single neuron, and you get a bunch of inputs and produce specific outputs according to specific rules. You live in the fusiform face area, but you don't actually know what faces look like, ergo you have no understanding of faces, ergo neurons don't understand faces, ergo you can't actually perceive faces" which obviously doesn't work - you are attributing intentionality to the component and not to the system, and the system is what actually does the "understanding", which Searle just waves away as "<a href="https://www.theproofistrivial.com/">obviously ridiculous</a>".

<li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ngoodman/papers/GerstenbergGoodman2012.pdf">Ping Pong in Church (Gerstenberg and Goodman 2012)</a> using probabilistic programming to make inferences about tournament results given sparse amounts of information (a topic very near to my heart, as anyone that knows me knows). Uses very toy examples with very few players, but "Probabilistic Language of Thought" matches human intuition despite very limited amount of information (i.e. A beats B, and B beats C and D, so A is probably pretty good). Interested to see if this sort of approach scales much further beyond four players, perhaps something to look into myself.

<li><a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/GouldLewontin.pdf">The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian program: A critique of the adaptationist programme (S.J. Gould 1979)</a> Senseless adaptationism is no different from saying inane stuff like "noses are the perfect shape for glasses, so we must have evolved to wear glasses." The causality is directly backwards; just because something is <i>used</i> for something, does not necessarily mean it was <i>evolved</i> for <i>that specific use</i> (sexual selection for blushing doesn't tell us why blood is red). Plus, it's not really falsifiable; it's just a fun story. "[he said] it was obvious that the delicate mouths of the [sweat] glands required the protection given to them by the [fingerprint] ridges on either side of them&#x2026; I replied that his arguments were beautiful and deserved to be true, but it happened that the mouths of the ducts did not run in the valleys between the crests, but along the crests of the ridges themselves."

How much of the enormous redundancy is to provide system level functionality if part of the system is attacked? How much of the complex process of wiring a brain during development is to prevent pathogen re-wiring?" Claims complex animal brains evolved robustness and strong defense due to selection pressure from parasites - the blood-brain barrier to restrict access to the brain, decoy molecules to trick parasites into binding something useless, increasing the costs of manipulation, increasing the complexity of signals, etc. Animal brains can perform a sort of targeted dropout when they detect that their activations are unusual in some way (as a means of foiling manipulation).

You can model lots of types of behavior pretty well with typical bayesian analysis, one interesting idea being the idea that if you have a single example of things in a known super-category (i.e. one cow, which is an animal) then you can reason that it's probably close to other cows in a similar way that sheep are close to other sheep. You can find the best structure for different problems!
</li>
<li><a href="http://vision.ucsf.edu/dunnlab/Platt1964.pdf">Strong Inference (Platt 1964)</a> you can make much faster progress through uncharted territory if you rigidly iterate between hypothesizing, designing experiments, and executing the experiments. Argues most scientists just do random bs and write as if they knew steps 1, 2, and 3 all along. "The difference between the average scientist's informal methods and the methods of the strong-inference users is somewhat like the difference between a gasoline engine that fires occasionally and one that fires in steady sequence. If our motorboat engines were as erratic as our deliberate intellectual efforts, most of us would not get home for supper" (ouch!)

<li><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p3105ed">The Head and The Hands (Koenderink 2002)</a> Some cool thoughts on research practices of "thinking with your head" and "thinking with your hands", i.e. theorizing and experimenting, and how people often dramatically prefer one to the other. Interesting contrast with Platt's strong inference paper. I think the takeaway here is that both of these are pretty important; if you think about the scientific method as an english version of bayes' theorem, sometimes you just need to open the door a few times to give yourself any sort of prior at all.

Research findings are more likely to be false if the sample size is small, the effect size is small, the greater number / lesser selection of tested relationships, the relationships are handwavey (i.e. "condition worsens"), the greater financial interests exists, and the hotter a scientific field is (please see: artificial intelligence). The title is, perhaps, deliberately provocative, but all of this just follows from the <i>definitions</i> of p-values and statistical power (the latter of which is usually ignored), so you should pay attention and remember to do your bonferonni corrections, etc. "a finding from a well-conducted adequately powered randomized controlled trial starting with a 50% pre-study chance that intervention is effective is eventually true about 85% of the time" (!). Argues we should stop chasing statistical significance and spend more time understanding the range of R values (i.e. priors).

<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232512003_Fuzzy_methodology">Fuzzy Methodology (Cohen 1992)</a> a quick two-pager about a psychologist with a relatively important publication that almost tossed the whole thing because statisticians told him his methodology was trivial and lacked rigor. Cohen's contribution wasn't the methodology (which was, after all, trivial and fuzzy) but the bridging of two fields in a novel way. "obsessed by the issue of statistical significance, for a quantitative science, psychology has a remarkably low level of awareness of just how big the phenomena with which it deals." Advice for publications: 1. be brilliant, 2. write on methodology, 3. write to answer a widely felt need, 4. be lucky (useful for AI conferences, also, "rub a rabbit's foot as you drop your manuscript into the mailbox"). Cognitive Science might make you self-conscious from being learned in many fields but not necessarily world-expert in all of them, but you can frame this more positively as harnessing <i>Shoshin</i>.

<li><a href="http://www.fpce.uc.pt/niips/area_ps/disci/mips/McGuire_1997.pdf">Creative Hypothesis Generating in Psychology (Cohen 1992)</a> Heuristics for generating hypotheses (through the lens of psychology), broadly split into five categories: deliberately noticing provocative natural occurences, direct inference, mediated inference, reinterpreting existing research, and analyses on data, further subdivided into subcategories containing specific heuristics (nice table on page 4-5). Not all of these apply to every researcher but a useful read to think about how you generate your own hypotheses and if you're too strongly limiting the <i>actual ways</i> in which you come up with your ideas (e.g. only after reading tons of things about the topic). Amusing was Heuristic G22 - physiological prod to jolt one's thinking - in which he discusses using substances to alter your thinking to allow you to come up with more ideas, something no doubt inspired by Paul Erdos' morbidly amusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%25C5%2591s#Personality">amphetamine use</a>.

I feel like I got a lot out of taking all of these courses (they took me about a month to get through all 5, although I had the luxury of a lot of time to spend on it), and I think Andrew Ng's teaching style is very clear and he gets the big-picture ideas into the student relatively quickly, which I appreciated about these lectures. I think Ng glosses over a huge body of information in an effort to make the course more approachable, but it ends up being a giant meme (don't worry if you don't understand this / backprop is the most complicated thing in all of deep learning / if you're an expert in calculus you'll know the definition of derivatives, but don't worry if you aren't / etc). I think most of this course is taught at roughly a high school level (maybe for a student concurrently taking calculus if you want to really get all the little details), so I'd probably recommend this as a starting point for someone interested in AI. I sorta regret taking course 4 and 5 before 1,2, and 3, but it didn't dramatically affect my experience either way and I got tons of anki flashcards out of it regardless. Onto the next resource!

<p>
The links page has become, weirdly enough, one of my favorite projects. I'm reminded of a suggestion I heard a long time ago (I think it was from Day9 but I am unsure) to keep a journal full of awesome things you have done so you can look back at it whenever you feel down about yourself. It's really cool being able to flip through and at a glance see where all your time in a year went, which months were strong and which were weak, etc. 
</p>

<p>
A useful thing I can do here is briefly reflect on 2018 and how it squared with what my goals were for the year:
</p>

<p>
I read 11/30 books, 9 reviewed on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25277520-eryk-banatt">my goodreads page</a>, one being a re-read (Once a Runner), and one being Anokh's <i>The Book of Melee</i> which I obviously won't review extensively due to it being currently unreleased.
</p>

<p>
I wrote 7 longform posts on this website (Homestuck CV, STARS ALIGNED annotations, Celeste Review, Anki notes, Projects page, Boredom Types rant, Making Sense of Melee), I made 6 videos (Shinelock Punishes, Box Practical Tech, Bombs over Battlefield, Shine 2018 Clips, STARS ALIGNED, Stray Saturday), I made semi-regular appearances on the <i>Melee Stats Podcast</i>, and I revamped this website to be a lot more efficient (i.e. easier to read, mobile friendly, auto-generated from org mode documents, better in general overall). My original goal was just "15 longform posts" which I set rather aggressively to encourage shorter writings (i.e. ones that don't require months of work like Making Sense of Melee, the Homestuck CV project, STARS ALIGNED and it's annotations etc) so I it'll be okay if I cheat a little bit and consider this goal met just via converting quantity of work from one format to another.
</p>

<p>
I'm unsure if I'd consider myself the fittest I've ever been but I've made some substantial progress on that front and I'm pretty satisfied with that. I think I need to learn how to balance the different types of training into somethat that works for me because it's hard to me to juggle everything (e.g. I stop running if I go to the gym more, I stop going to the gym if I focus on rock climbing, etc). 
</p>

<p>
I think overall I'm pleased with how I was able to focus on goals I defined myself throughout 2018. I had a lot to show for my use of free time in 2018, and probably are most proud of <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ambistats.html">these</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGpB5d5nuPg">three</a> <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/visualdistance.html">projects</a>. I think I could've done more - in particular there are two projects I started that fell through mostly due to my decision to focus on Melee a bit more during the summer (between EVO / Shine / Big House / etc). Likewise I didn't do anywhere near enough reading, at least as far as books go. I was mostly good about staying on task but there were a few months where I felt like I accomplished almost nothing. These were generally in the summer, and in general I found it difficult to get back into the swing of independent work after doing any sort of travelling. 
</p>

<p>
Anyways, 2019 goals:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dramatically restructure life to spend higher percentage of time doing things I find interesting instead of just a few hours a day
</li>
<li>Complete 15 projects, four of them being "large projects", at least five of them including a longform writing component
</li>
<li>Read 20 books
</li>
<li>Become strong
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
"I wish to clarify that an inherent danger of climbing the social ladder in small communities is that a player can lose sight of the intense sway that they hold. Even falsities can be accepted by the weaker party when enough people gather around the stronger individual. Those with high capital should seek to view discourse in light of their own authority, and consider whether or not their opinion is actually correct or if their authority has preceded them."

<li><b>Attended The Big House 8</b> got 97th place which is pretty solid for me; I can be so much better than I currently am and I have lots of footage to review. In general this low-pressure headspace I was in was very good and is worth experimenting with more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLczW29iRM_QdoOL7Oy4bm0b6-BCkmSlCz">bracket matches</a>

<li><b>Updated the iframe CSS on this website</b> Youtube videos / gfycats no longer look completely stupid, nor are they insanely vertically stretched on mobile.
</li>
<li><b>Began taking Creatine</b> been thinking about taking this since I’ve heard mixed things about its effect on cognition (mostly during sleep deprivation) but now that I’m lifting weights 3x/week I figured it was worth taking regularly. Hard to separate out what is from creatine and what is from just getting stronger, but the water retention effect was much stronger than I anticipated.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Sent a V3 Problem</b> Didn't get a video recording of it, but I sent an interesting slab problem at The Gravity Vault in Randor, PA. In my send I got stuck on the last move for maybe three full minutes before getting past it with a weird coordination mantle + pistol squat move, which I felt really good about even though it suggests my move into the last move was probably not super optimal.
</li>
<li><b>Sent another, different V3 Problem</b> Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvj-iehyW9g">here</a>, another relatively easy problem which I abused my height to make easier. I want to send this cleaner (as I did with that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rmQWE4jCbY">super weird teal V2</a> that everyone at my gym hates, myself included). I really liked the mini cut-loose move near the end but I think this climb would be easier with better footwork especially after the third hand move (flag is unnecessary). I think a footswap after the fifth hand move -&gt; move right foot to hold right next to it skips the need for cutting loose, but I could be misunderstanding how good the holds are from that position from this video. Overall I think definitely a relatively easy v3 which I think is appropriate for what I consider my current level at climbing (V2+/V3-)
</li>
<li><b>Practiced a bunch for Evo 2018</b> I'm very excited for this event and I think I'm in pretty good form for it - I'm unsure if I'll do well or not but I'm looking forward to playing a lot of great melee with strong players and having a good time in Las Vegas.

young anki cards of about 8%, and no change in mature cards. I didn't
do any blinding, and would probably have to revisit this if I wanted
to explore it deeply in any capacity. I don't really feel like bacopa
gave me anything super valuable given the magnitude of the effect, so
I've discontinued taking it (although I might consider taking it
again if I ever decide to become a student again). Funny to think
about how effectively you can replace the use of short term memory
with good external capturing like anki or Evernote.

A pretty interesting look at how different teams perform at different

player so the nuances of choosing 15 minutes as a threshold / the
importance of dragons vs gold / etc are lost on me, but the analysis
strategy is pretty interesting and I enjoyed reading it. (Also reminded

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091026234156/http://geocities.com/currintrading/">Currin
Trading - Ambition, Deception, Honor, Redemption: The story of the
biggest heist in Eve's history</a> Half chilling, half fascinating - Eve
Online scammer details how he ran a ponzi scheme disguised as a
fraudulent trading corporation in-game, eventually leading to him making
away with 30 billion isk (A few thousand dollars). There's a lot of
really amusing anecdotes in here (he claims he didn't sell the isk for
real money because he didn't want to break the terms of service, he
mentions the playerbase revolting after the moderators returned money
from a different scam, and that he had intended to return as much of it
as possible before being mistakenly banned and changing his mind upon
the reversal), and it reads like a wild criminal testimonial for someone
who knows he's not going to face any repercussions. In the end he blew
the whistle on another scammer, the EVE Interstellar Bank, a scam that
netted <i>that</i> scammer 750 billion isk (~$80k USD).
</p>

<p>
"those who did not make specific requests, and instead asked open-ended
questions like "how can I trust you?" and "how do I know this is for
real?"&#x2013;these were future investors. They were asking me to persuade
them. They wanted to believe."
</p>

<p>
"People who posted on the forums seemed to have a negative attitude
about everything. Rather than being a cross-section of the Eve populace,
the forums were populated by a group disparagingly known as "the forum
superstars"&#x2013;people who spent all their time on the forums instead of
actually playing the game. Not only did they have a fame and influence
far out of proportion to their playing abilities, they were accused of
getting special treatment from the administrators of the Eve servers.
But it was their persistent scorn for anyone making anything new&#x2013;and
their seeming inability to make their own positive contributions to the
game&#x2013;that maintained the ordinary players' low regard for them."
</p>

<p>
"In the end, I decided that the only value in having stolen all of that
isk was not the isk itself, but the stealing of it. I wanted to see if I
could do the impossible, and I did it. The more I pondered the actual
value of isk, the more I saw that the only people who really valued it
were the ones who had earned it themselves. Despite Eve being a game,
they had put real work into it. Many of them had spent three years
shooting rocks and hauling modules around to earn that isk, and now it
would be gone."
</p>

<p>
"Only now did I appreciate just how insidious a scam could be. I had
thought the isk meant nothing to me. That it was just a means to an end,
a score to beat. But now I was willing to wreak devastation upon all of
my investors just to hold onto it. The scam had scammed me. It stole my
concern for others and replaced it with gluttony. I was disgusted. I
lied. I cheated people. I used people to help me scam their friends. I
was the cause of widespread bankruptcy. But the most damning thing of
all? I think I can live with it, and if I had it to do all over again, I
would. To my surprise, a guilty conscience was a small price to pay for
thirty billion isk. So I will learn to live with it, because I can live
with it."

<a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ambistats.html">Making Sense of
Melee: The Illusion of Objective Ranks and the Real Impact of
Everything</a> The culmination of my most recent long-term Melee Stats
project where I gathered tons of tournament sets and examined trends in
the data - I used this data for seeding and for my SSBMRank Ballot, and
this post details my further scrutinizing of the patterns within. The
post got a lot more attention than I was expecting! (It got something
like 56k views if my rough, then-poor analytics are to be trusted).
Somebody posted it to
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16255910">Hacker News</a> where it
ended up reaching #6, and it got tons of shares on
<a href="https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/957830089110147072">Twitter</a>.

Trauma, and Human Resilience - Have We Underestimated the Human Capacity
to Thrive After Extremely Aversive Events?</a> A surprisingly optimistic
paper which suggests that most people are actually impressively
resilient after aversive events. Because so many people that show up to
clinicians after bad things happen are in need of clinicians to help
them, the prevailing view was that when bad things happen to people they
usually need time to grieve. However, the sample size was very
self-selecting here, and exploring more "normal" baselines suggest its
possible that on average people are pretty good about staying functional
through traumatic events.

go back and read through this if I forget something or if I encounter a
grammatical structure that I am unfamiliar with. I really appreciated
the structure and despite it being a little wonky at first it made the
rest of the guide pretty simple to understand since everything made some
sense from a Japanese-speaking perspective rather than an
English-speaking one imposed upon the Japanese language. Gonna start

randomly due to weird level geometry problems, having issues with the
camera, etc, and I eventually made it a game to see how many stars I
could get by BLJing past walls instead of actually earning them. I had
fun with it, but I couldn't manage to 100% it because there were just
some stars that were so broken that I got too frustrated to continue

is a more updated version of the paper I mentioned last month, so I'm
putting it here.

<i><a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf">Example of the Glicko-2
System</a></i> I ran this on a database of 22k super smash brothers melee
tournament set results, after ELO gave me mediocre results. The results
were better than ELO but still not very good.

vs Luigi (Chillindude829)</a></i> Watched this after playing a set at Shine
2017 against a luigi and realizing that I didn't have a firm
understanding of my goals in this matchup (shine doesn't lead to
anything, grab doesn't lead to anything, so what are you going for in
neutral against luigi? What's your gameplan? I ended up just going for
random hits and getting steamrolled). Takeaways: uptilt vs nairs, dash
attack is a common mixup situation (nair out jump out etc), usually
avoid midrange (close/far is good), Disjoints are good (uptilt, falling
upair). Being above luigi is very good. Empty drill into fullhop is
pretty good because you can punish grab attempts with falling upair.

around, and yet I actually believe. tl;dr these two are shooting a
documentary about a now-shut-down modded video game, and got in contact
with a reclusive developer "Magus" who moves into their apartment to
help them with the documentary. However, it turns out that the person
that claimed to be Magus was actually somebody impersonating Magus,
having done so for months and knowing intimate information that
"verified" their identity with other dev team members. Nobody knows who
this person was, or how they knew so much about Magus and the internal
details of the development team, and everybody is freaked out about it.

which uses a hardcoded goals hierarchy rather than learning it all via
deep reinforcement learning. These fall under what I call "Watson
Syndrome" where they are capable of winning because of their superior
"biology" rather than actually outplaying their opponents, and as such I
don't think these are particularly useful as training tools (I.e. A
"winning position" for the AI is not necessarily winning for a human, if
such a situation requires something like frame perfect reaction time,
and attempting to emulate its playstyle would likely be extremely
foolish, unlike with Deep Blue or AlphaGo. For games with a biological
element [Melee, Dota, Jeopardy] emulating realistic biology is important
before you can announce "triumph" over human players.)

structured by radical / Mnemonic but with actual readings (which RTK did
not have - I have a copy of it and I'm using it for kanji I'm having
trouble with but as a method by itself it seems pretty terrible). Some
of the suggestions for remembering things in genetickanji are bad / big
stretches, but overall it's nicely structured and not too big a
commitment to figure out.

great.

<i>Berlitz Complete Japanese</i> A good series of dialogues to introduce
basic Japanese grammar (I'm still very much a beginner but I imagine
this is all N5 level). The dialogues are charming enough to keep you
reasonably engaged - I found myself more amused than I ought to be
listening to Harrison-san's antics, which I think is a good thing for
this type of resource. The dialogues are completely in Japanese, which
is what I wanted, but things become confusing if you can't figure out
what words mean so this might be worth supplementing with another
textbook, a dictionary, or the workbook. There's some weirdness
(pronouncing wo particle actually as "wo" sometimes) but overall good to
listen to if you want to practice listening/speaking
</p>

<p>
<i>Introductory Statistics with R</i> A book that I think is best suited
either with a teacher or with another, more traditional, statistics
textbook. Using R has proven very useful, but the book was heavy with
jargon that it did not explain properly, and I frequently felt lost
despite making flashcards and reading very carefully. Certain concepts
are vaguely explained or not explained at all, and you're expected to
have a minimum level of knowledge that I felt was inappropriate given
that it also explained really basic stuff like factorials. Overall a
useful book that added a good tool to my toolkit, but one that
frequently had me googling things for clarification.

<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria_(manga)">Aria</a></i> Slow, relaxing,
with some basic scifi concepts, works better as a manga than an anime
due to pacing. Fits the genre of "utopia that isn't a utopia", everyone
just sort of lazily goes about their days and most of the story is
literally about being able to slow down and admire the scenery around
you (MC's entire personality type, as well as the job of the Primas).

<p>
<i><a href="https://www.gwern.net/Aria's%20past,%20present,%20and%20future">Aria's
Past, Present, and Future (Gwern)</a></i> Hilarious, I've always had a soft
spot for violating suspension of disbelief and then trying to explain it
away using crazy theories. Reminds me a lot of the
"<a href="http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Matrix_in_a_Matrix_theory">Matrix in a
Matrix</a>" theory, where people plugged the ridiculous left-field plot
hole of Matrix Reloaded as evidence that, since Neo can use powers in
the "real world", it's likely not the real world - just another layer of
fabrication that Neo pulled his punches in because he didn't believe he
had powers in there. Probably false, but a fun way to engage with plot
holes!

<i>Koe no Katachi (2016)</i> - I think as good of a film adaptation as I
could have reasonably expected from condensing this rather long story
into a two hour film. Pacing issues that were not present in the manga,
parts felt extremely rushed due to cutting out some smaller arcs to make
time. Characters didn't have enough time to properly develop into
believable characters with the exception of the main character, again a
byproduct of lack of time. Where this film shines is sound direction, it
uses silence and white noise extremely well, which compliments the films
themes (hearing vs listening / blocking out the world / etc). The
animation is fantastic as well, Kyoto Animation delivers as you might
expect. Overall not quite as good as the manga adaptation, but not bad
by any means.
