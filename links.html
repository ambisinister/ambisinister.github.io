			<h1>Monthly Links</h1>

			<p> This page is mostly a log in which I keep links to things I've read, made, done, etc. It's separated by month, along with my goals for the next month, and should be end up being in reverse chronological order (i.e. with the most recent month at the very top). The formatting might not be super great because I export these from evernote and just paste them in, but for the most part this page exists just to keep me accountable for how much I accomplish from month-to-month. </p>

			<h2> 2017 </h2>

			<h2 id="yearend2017">Year End 2017</h2>

				<h3 id="goalsforjanuary">Goals for January</h3>

				<ul>
				<li>Build something interesting with the Raspberry Pi 3 kit I got for Christmas, use Amazon Gift Cards to buy assorted things if need be</li>

				<li>I've made very good progress on my more recent melee stats project and expect to be finished very shortly - the only reason I could imagine it taking longer than end of January is incorporation of top 100 data for further analysis</li>

				<li>learn a bunch of slow cooker recipes </li>

				<li>Work on the infrastructure of this website - Maybe add Disqus comments, an RSS feed, make it slightly nicer looking</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>

				<p><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/360view.html"><em>Seeing Everything: A Visual Perception Experiment Proposal</em></a>
				Not really a <em>project</em> per-se, more like a "man, somebody should do this" idea that I've had for a while that just won't really leave my head.</p>

				<h4 id="videos">Videos</h4>

				<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1jp0Q2KWi-E">Downwait Instant Ledgegrab</a>
				An attempt to make my videos a bit more visually appealing without sacrificing the content or the conciseness: I rarely feel that these sorts of demos warrant more than a 60 second video and I would like my content to remain highly valuable per unit time, but if I can put a bit of extra effort into them and have them be more polished without sacrificing this then I don't think there's any reason not to.</p>

				<h4 id="articles">Articles</h4>

				<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf">Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm</a>
				A wonderful paper that appeals to my AI and Chess-playing selves - Deepmind plays beautifully even with no input from humans whatsoever.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001541/">Cigarette smoking: an underused tool in high-performance endurance training</a>
				An incredible, hilarious paper that I plan on linking people frequently in the future - from the abstract: <em>"However, if research results are selectively chosen, a review has the potential to create a convincing argument for a faulty hypothesis. Improper correlation or extrapolation of data can result in dangerously flawed conclusions. The following paper seeks to illustrate this point, using existing research to argue the hypothesis that cigarette smoking enhances endurance performance and should be incorporated into high-level training programs."</em></p>

				<p><a href="http://kadano.net/SSBM/inputlag/">Kadano on Input Lag</a>

				<h3 id="resolutions">"Resolutions"</h3>

				<p>I generally dislike "New Years Resolutions" but I think keeping myself accountable for the things I want to accomplish over long periods of time is pretty important. As 2018 is the first year I will be completely operating without educational institutions to hand me goals (weird) I feel it is more important to have a clear vision of my long-term goals.</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Read 30 books</li>

				<li>Write 15 longform posts on this website, not including links posts</li>

				<li>Reach a point where creating a Patreon wouldn't be an embarrassing idea, create a Patreon, get at least three Patrons</li>

				</ul>

				<h4 id="books">Books</h4>

				<p><a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar</a> feels like a pretty comprehensive collection of grammar points in the Japanese language, and I suspect I will frequently go back and read through this if I forget something or if I encounter a grammatical structure that I am unfamiliar with. I really appreciated the structure and despite it being a little wonky at first it made the rest of the guide pretty simple to understand since everything made some sense from a Japanese-speaking perspective rather than an English-speaking one imposed upon the Japanese language. Gonna start working through Genki I now that I've gotten through this book.</p>

				<h4 id="videogames">Video Games</h4>

				<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/agecheck">Doki Doki Literature Club</a> Dan Salvato's new studio put out this game this month, and I played through it. The tl;dr on my thoughts is that this game manages to be cliche in two genres and draws far too much inspiration from creepypasta. Full thoughts <a href="./articles/ddlc.html">here</a>.</p>

				<p><a href="http://sm64hacks.com/hack.php?id=59">SM64: The Last Impact</a> a fun romhack that is technically interesting and has some cool ideas and fun levels, but suffers enormously from difficulty curve irregularity / bugs / poor level design. I found myself frequently getting softlocked, dying randomly due to weird level geometry problems, having issues with the camera, etc, and I eventually made it a game to see how many stars I could get by BLJing past walls instead of actually earning them. I had fun with it, but I couldn't manage to 100% it because there were just some stars that were so broken that I got too frustrated to continue playing. It made me appreciate how relatively not broken the original game was, and how important beta testing is for these sorts of games. </p>

				<p><a href="https://www.playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu">Playerunknown's Battlegrounds</a> A fun game to fool around with friends in, but not one I think is particularly well-designed from an esports perspective.</p>

				<h4 id="articles">Articles</h4>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/08/the-hotel-hacker/">The Hotel Room Hacker</a></em>

				<p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06230.pdf">Beating the World's Best at Super Smash Brothers with Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></em>
				I believe this is a more updated version of the paper I mentioned last month, so I'm putting it here.</p>

				<p><em><a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf">Example of the Glicko-2 System</a></em> 
				I ran this on a database of 22k super smash brothers melee tournament set results, after ELO gave me mediocre results. The results were better than ELO but still not very good.</p>

				<h4 id="videos-1">Videos</h4>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpql4uegZao">Earth Wind &amp; Fire, September - Bass Clarinet Choir</a></em></p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmbRTgjn2VQ">Learn Modal Jazz in 12 minutes. (No kidding.)</a></em>
				Man, I miss being really involved with music like I was in high school - I might pick up a music theory textbook and brush up on it. </p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDAseJvCpvk">How to Learn Music (Epistemology and Music in the Digital Age)</a></em>
				I'm not crazy about Malcolm Gladwell but this video I think is a really well-worded depiction of learning skills in general. I've watched a bunch of Adam Neely's videos and he strikes me as extremely well-read, I was impressed by how interesting all of his videos were while still consistently being about music each time.</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p9_GxicLlw">Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - All Dungeons, No Doors TAS</a></em> Crazy</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNh_Ney87Y">Matchup Breakdown - Fox vs Luigi (Chillindude829)</a></em>
				Watched this after playing a set at Shine 2017 against a luigi and realizing that I didn't have a firm understanding of my goals in this matchup (shine doesn't lead to anything, grab doesn't lead to anything, so what are you going for in neutral against luigi? What's your gameplan? I ended up just going for random hits and getting steamrolled). Takeaways: uptilt vs nairs, dash attack is a common mixup situation (nair out jump out etc), usually avoid midrange (close/far is good), Disjoints are good (uptilt, falling upair). Being above luigi is very good. Empty drill into fullhop is pretty good because you can punish grab attempts with falling upair. </p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uO1XE2MSnc">A YouTube choir: the history of the most viewed videos converted into sound</a></em>
				Perfect blend of Music, Math, Visualization, and Shitposting. I got a huge kick out of the inclusion of "All I Want For Christmas Is You" which predictably shot up every december and then didn't move for the rest of the year.</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChPO9yPOy8c">"Rewrite" Production Vlog #6: Everything is Fucked Up</a></em>
				This is one of those "Truth is stranger than fiction" type of stories I struggle to wrap my head around, and yet I actually believe. tl;dr these two are shooting a documentary about a now-shut-down modded video game, and got in contact with a reclusive developer "Magus" who moves into their apartment to help them with the documentary. However, it turns out that the person that claimed to be Magus was actually somebody impersonating Magus, having done so for months and knowing intimate information that "verified" their identity with other dev team members. Nobody knows who this person was, or how they knew so much about Magus and the internal details of the development team, and everybody is freaked out about it.</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeItHAxLg9w">Batman: The Dark Knight Trilogy Cover - Pedrosaxo</a></em> Guy plays a duet with himself, seems very technically demanding. I don't play saxophone but what I'm vaguely sure is going on here is he's using the same technique you use for circular breathing in order to hum a note at the same time he produces a note on his instrument, resulting in two notes being played. Very neat!</p>

			<h2 id="August2017"> August 2017 </h2>
				<h3>Goals for September</h3>

				<ul>
				<li>Finish Tae Kim Guide to Japanese (~75% complete) and move on to Genki I</li>

				<li>Finish the books I'm currently reading, as well as GEB and the fast.ai MOOC</li>

				<li>establish working demo of melee stats page, scrape at least 8000 sets, learn enough webdev to get a working prototype complete by the end of the month</li>

				<li>write draft for posts on spaced repetition, man vs AI publicity stunts, melee stats analysis</li>

				<li>join a gym, begin resistance training, begin eating at a surplus</li>

				<li>other potential project ideas: something with Keras (MP3 file -> osu map? Too much?), do pot bonuses boost attendance at melee tournaments? </li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Things I've made</h3>

				<h4>Writing:</h4>

				<p><em><a href="./articles/health.html">Optimizing health with cronometer</a></em>
				I hit my weight goal, going to start resistance training next</p>

				<p><em><a href="./articles/omron.html">How variable are Omron Scales</a></em>
				Since I met my weight goal I tested the variability of my scale a second time. If I gain weight in a substantially lean way and get my old values for bodyfat, I'll conclude that the scales results are useless. Otherwise, I'll measure what it returns.</p>

				<h3>Links</h3>

				<h4>Blogposts, Web</h4>

				<p><em>OpenAI Dota 2 AI</em> <a href="https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/">[1]</a> <a href="https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/">[2]</a>
				Not good enough at dota to make an accurate assessment. Compare to Vlad "Xpilot" Firoiu's <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/108984/986497700-MIT.pdf?sequence=1">master's thesis at MIT</a> Philip the Falcon Ditto AI, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXJUlqBsZtE">can beat good players</a>; as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qWHM8DNdr8">SmashBot</a>, which uses a hardcoded goals hierarchy rather than learning it all via deep reinforcement learning.  These fall under what I call "Watson Syndrome" where they are capable of winning because of their superior "biology" rather than actually outplaying their opponents, and as such I don't think these are particularly useful as training tools (I.e. A "winning position" for the AI is not necessarily winning for a human, if such a situation requires something like frame perfect reaction time, and attempting to emulate its playstyle would likely be extremely foolish, unlike with Deep Blue or AlphaGo. For games with a biological element [Melee, Dota, Jeopardy] emulating realistic biology is important before you can announce "triumph" over human players.)</p>

				<p><em><a href="http://www.genetickanji.com/grade1.asp">Genetickanji - Kanji Grade 1</a></em>
				I've been doing five of these each day and have gone through a little over 100 this month - I specifically wanted something reasonably structured by radical / Mnemonic but with actual readings (which RTK did not have - I have a copy of it and I'm using it for kanji I'm having trouble with but as a method by itself it seems pretty terrible). Some of the suggestions for remembering things in genetickanji are bad / big stretches, but overall it's nicely structured and not too big a commitment to figure out.</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/ambisinister_/status/903323311089885185">Bet on UCF not being at any majors</a></em>
				I bet $10 with @uconnsdoom that UCF is not present at Big House 7, Summit, Genesis, CEO, or EVO.</p>

				<h4>Papers</h4>

				<p><em><a href="https://makegirlsmoe.github.io/assets/pdf/technical_report.pdf">Create Anime Characters With A.I.! (Jin et al 2017)</a></em>
				amazing / hilarious / surprisingly straightforward, particularly enjoyed the section on generating release-date-specific images ("as you can see from figure 5... the more recent images are cuter and higher quality")</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28742910/">Clinicopathological Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in Players of American Football (Mez et al 2017)</a></em>
				Football is a moral evil and inherently dangerous (half kidding). A somewhat self-selecting sample, but the effect size is so large that this could be considered a huge blow to the idea that "football is safe enough for children".</p>

				<p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.06643.pdf">Predicting Personality from Book Preferences with User-Generated Content Labels (Annalyn et al 2017)</a></em>
				A cool paper exploring differences in personality among people who enjoy certain genres of books, using user-submitted tags on goodreads and declared preferences on facebook. The visualization in this paper is excellent, and although I don't think the paper's conclusion is that powerful (correlation between a preference + big 5 feels pretty unimportant) I think the methodology was great.</p>

				<h4>Books / Audiobooks</h4>

				<p><em>Berlitz Complete Japanese</em>
				A good series of dialogues to introduce basic Japanese grammar (I'm still very much a beginner but I imagine this is all N5 level). The dialogues are charming enough to keep you reasonably engaged - I found myself more amused than I ought to be listening to Harrison-san's antics, which I think is a good thing for this type of resource. The dialogues are completely in Japanese, which is what I wanted, but things become confusing if you can't figure out what words mean so this might be worth supplementing with another textbook, a dictionary, or the workbook. There's some weirdness (pronouncing wo particle actually as "wo" sometimes) but overall good to listen to if you want to practice listening/speaking</p>

				<p><em>Introductory Statistics with R</em>
				A book that I think is best suited either with a teacher or with another, more traditional, statistics textbook. Using R has proven very useful, but the book was heavy with jargon that it did not explain properly, and I frequently felt lost despite making flashcards and reading very carefully. Certain concepts are vaguely explained or not explained at all, and you're expected to have a minimum level of knowledge that I felt was inappropriate given that it also explained really basic stuff like factorials. Overall a useful book that added a good tool to my toolkit, but one that frequently had me googling things for clarification.</p>

				<h4>Manga</h4>

				<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria_(manga)">Aria</a></em>
				Slow, relaxing, with some basic scifi concepts, works better as a manga than an anime due to pacing. Fits the genre of "utopia that isn't a utopia", everyone just sort of lazily goes about their days and most of the story is literally about being able to slow down and admire the scenery around you (MC's entire personality type, as well as the job of the Primas). </p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.gwern.net/Aria%27s%20past,%20present,%20and%20future">Aria's Past, Present, and Future (Gwern)</a></em>
				Hilarious, I've always had a soft spot for violating suspension of disbelief and then trying to explain it away using crazy theories. Reminds me a lot of the "<a href="http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Matrix_in_a_Matrix_theory">Matrix in a Matrix</a>" theory, where people plugged the ridiculous left-field plot hole of Matrix Reloaded as evidence that, since Neo can use powers in the "real world", it's likely not the real world - just another layer of fabrication that Neo pulled his punches in because he didn't believe he had powers in there. Probably false, but a fun way to engage with plot holes!</p>

				<h4>Anime</h4>

				<p><em>Koe no Katachi (2016)</em> - I think as good of a film adaptation as I could have reasonably expected from condensing this rather long story into a two hour film. Pacing issues that were not present in the manga, parts felt extremely rushed due to cutting out some smaller arcs to make time. Characters didn't have enough time to properly develop into believable characters with the exception of the main character, again a byproduct of lack of time. Where this film shines is sound direction, it uses silence and white noise extremely well, which compliments the films themes (hearing vs listening / blocking out the world / etc). The animation is fantastic as well, Kyoto Animation delivers as you might expect. Overall not quite as good as the manga adaptation, but not bad by any means.</p>

				<h4>Videos</h4>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajM4vYCZMZk">Carolina Eyck - The Ecstasy of Gold (Theremin &amp; Voice Cover)</a></em></p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS_yNsDsbaQ">残酷な天使のテーゼ (A Cruel Angel's Thesis) まるやまたつや (Guitar)</a></em></p>

				<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE4eplsFSms">Learn to Read Korean in 5 Minutes (seriously)</a></em>
				doesn't get all the letters in but a cool intro to the ease of this alphabet, I made flashcards for Hangul via wikipedia + 15 easy useful phrases </p>
