The links page has become, weirdly enough, one of my favorite projects. I'm reminded of a suggestion I heard a long time ago (I think it was from Day<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> but I am unsure) to keep a journal full of awesome things you have done so you can look back at it whenever you feel down about yourself. It's really cool being able to flip through and at a glance see where all your time in a year went, which months were strong and which were weak, etc. 
</p>

<p>
A useful thing I can do here is briefly reflect on 2018 and how it squared with what my goals were for the year:
</p>

<p>
I read 11/30 books, 9 reviewed on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25277520-eryk-banatt">my goodreads page</a>, one being a re-read (Once a Runner), and one being Anokh's <i>The Book of Melee</i> which I obviously won't review extensively due to it being currently unreleased.
</p>

<p>
I wrote 7 longform posts on this website (Homestuck CV, STARS ALIGNED annotations, Celeste Review, Anki notes, Projects page, Boredom Types rant, Making Sense of Melee), I made 6 videos (Shinelock Punishes, Box Practical Tech, Bombs over Battlefield, Shine 2018 Clips, STARS ALIGNED, Stray Saturday), I made semi-regular appearances on the <i>Melee Stats Podcast</i>, and I revamped this website to be a lot more efficient (i.e. easier to read, mobile friendly, auto-generated from org mode documents, better in general overall). My original goal was just "15 longform posts" which I set rather aggressively to encourage shorter writings (i.e. ones that don't require months of work like Making Sense of Melee, the Homestuck CV project, STARS ALIGNED and it's annotations etc) so I it'll be okay if I cheat a little bit and consider this goal met just via converting quantity of work from one format to another.
</p>

<p>
I'm unsure if I'd consider myself the fittest I've ever been but I've made some substantial progress on that front and I'm pretty satisfied with that. I think I need to learn how to balance the different types of training into somethat that works for me because it's hard to me to juggle everything (e.g. I stop running if I go to the gym more, I stop going to the gym if I focus on rock climbing, etc). 
</p>

<p>
I think overall I'm pleased with how I was able to focus on goals I defined myself throughout 2018. I had a lot to show for my use of free time in 2018, and probably are most proud of <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ambistats.html">these</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGpB5d5nuPg">three</a> <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/visualdistance.html">projects</a>. I think I could've done more - in particular there are two projects I started that fell through mostly due to my decision to focus on Melee a bit more during the summer (between EVO / Shine / Big House / etc). Likewise I didn't do anywhere near enough reading, at least as far as books go. I was mostly good about staying on task but there were a few months where I felt like I accomplished almost nothing. These were generally in the summer, and in general I found it difficult to get back into the swing of independent work after doing any sort of travelling. 
</p>

<p>
Anyways, 2019 goals:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dramatically restructure life to spend higher percentage of time doing things I find interesting instead of just a few hours a day
</li>
<li>Complete 15 projects, four of them being "large projects", at least five of them including a longform writing component
</li>
<li>Read 20 books
</li>
<li>Become strong
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
"I wish to clarify that an inherent danger of climbing the social ladder in small communities is that a player can lose sight of the intense sway that they hold. Even falsities can be accepted by the weaker party when enough people gather around the stronger individual. Those with high capital should seek to view discourse in light of their own authority, and consider whether or not their opinion is actually correct or if their authority has preceded them."

<li><b>Sent a V3 Problem</b> Didn't get a video recording of it, but I sent an interesting slab problem at The Gravity Vault in Randor, PA. In my send I got stuck on the last move for maybe three full minutes before getting past it with a weird coordination mantle + pistol squat move, which I felt really good about even though it suggests my move into the last move was probably not super optimal.
</li>
<li><b>Sent another, different V3 Problem</b> Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvj-iehyW9g">here</a>, another relatively easy problem which I abused my height to make easier. I want to send this cleaner (as I did with that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rmQWE4jCbY">super weird teal V2</a> that everyone at my gym hates, myself included). I really liked the mini cut-loose move near the end but I think this climb would be easier with better footwork especially after the third hand move (flag is unnecessary). I think a footswap after the fifth hand move -&gt; move right foot to hold right next to it skips the need for cutting loose, but I could be misunderstanding how good the holds are from that position from this video. Overall I think definitely a relatively easy v3 which I think is appropriate for what I consider my current level at climbing (V2+/V3-)
</li>
<li><b>Practiced a bunch for Evo 2018</b> I'm very excited for this event and I think I'm in pretty good form for it - I'm unsure if I'll do well or not but I'm looking forward to playing a lot of great melee with strong players and having a good time in Las Vegas.

<a href="https://examine.com/supplements/bacopa-monnieri/">Bacopa
Monnieri</a>. Ended up observing a rise in correct answers for new +
young anki cards of about 8%, and no change in mature cards. I didn't
do any blinding, and would probably have to revisit this if I wanted
to explore it deeply in any capacity. I don't really feel like bacopa
gave me anything super valuable given the magnitude of the effect, so
I've discontinued taking it (although I might consider taking it
again if I ever decide to become a student again). Funny to think
about how effectively you can replace the use of short term memory
with good external capturing like anki or Evernote.

AND MLR: NEW TEAM RATINGS</a> Shown to me by Shi Deng of Big Blue esports.
A pretty interesting look at how different teams perform at different
stages of a match in league of legends; sadly I'm not much of a league
player so the nuances of choosing 15 minutes as a threshold / the
importance of dragons vs gold / etc are lost on me, but the analysis
strategy is pretty interesting and I enjoyed reading it. (Also reminded
me that I need to learn to implement k-fold cross validation)

Trading - Ambition, Deception, Honor, Redemption: The story of the
biggest heist in Eve's history</a> Half chilling, half fascinating - Eve
Online scammer details how he ran a ponzi scheme disguised as a
fraudulent trading corporation in-game, eventually leading to him making
away with 30 billion isk (A few thousand dollars). There's a lot of
really amusing anecdotes in here (he claims he didn't sell the isk for
real money because he didn't want to break the terms of service, he
mentions the playerbase revolting after the moderators returned money
from a different scam, and that he had intended to return as much of it
as possible before being mistakenly banned and changing his mind upon
the reversal), and it reads like a wild criminal testimonial for someone
who knows he's not going to face any repercussions. In the end he blew
the whistle on another scammer, the EVE Interstellar Bank, a scam that
netted <i>that</i> scammer 750 billion isk (~$80k USD).
</p>

<p>
"those who did not make specific requests, and instead asked open-ended
questions like "how can I trust you?" and "how do I know this is for
real?"&#x2013;these were future investors. They were asking me to persuade
them. They wanted to believe."
</p>

<p>
"People who posted on the forums seemed to have a negative attitude
about everything. Rather than being a cross-section of the Eve populace,
the forums were populated by a group disparagingly known as "the forum
superstars"&#x2013;people who spent all their time on the forums instead of
actually playing the game. Not only did they have a fame and influence
far out of proportion to their playing abilities, they were accused of
getting special treatment from the administrators of the Eve servers.
But it was their persistent scorn for anyone making anything new&#x2013;and
their seeming inability to make their own positive contributions to the
game&#x2013;that maintained the ordinary players' low regard for them."
</p>

<p>
"In the end, I decided that the only value in having stolen all of that
isk was not the isk itself, but the stealing of it. I wanted to see if I
could do the impossible, and I did it. The more I pondered the actual
value of isk, the more I saw that the only people who really valued it
were the ones who had earned it themselves. Despite Eve being a game,
they had put real work into it. Many of them had spent three years
shooting rocks and hauling modules around to earn that isk, and now it
would be gone."
</p>

<p>
"Only now did I appreciate just how insidious a scam could be. I had
thought the isk meant nothing to me. That it was just a means to an end,
a score to beat. But now I was willing to wreak devastation upon all of
my investors just to hold onto it. The scam had scammed me. It stole my
concern for others and replaced it with gluttony. I was disgusted. I
lied. I cheated people. I used people to help me scam their friends. I
was the cause of widespread bankruptcy. But the most damning thing of
all? I think I can live with it, and if I had it to do all over again, I
would. To my surprise, a guilty conscience was a small price to pay for
thirty billion isk. So I will learn to live with it, because I can live
with it."

this post details my further scrutinizing of the patterns within. The

like 56k views if my rough, then-poor analytics are to be trusted).
Somebody posted it to

Trauma, and Human Resilience - Have We Underestimated the Human Capacity

paper which suggests that most people are actually impressively
resilient after aversive events. Because so many people that show up to
clinicians after bad things happen are in need of clinicians to help
them, the prevailing view was that when bad things happen to people they
usually need time to grieve. However, the sample size was very
self-selecting here, and exploring more "normal" baselines suggest its
possible that on average people are pretty good about staying functional
through traumatic events.

<a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Tae Kim's Guide to
Japanese Grammar</a> feels like a pretty comprehensive collection of
grammar points in the Japanese language, and I suspect I will frequently
go back and read through this if I forget something or if I encounter a
grammatical structure that I am unfamiliar with. I really appreciated
the structure and despite it being a little wonky at first it made the
rest of the guide pretty simple to understand since everything made some
sense from a Japanese-speaking perspective rather than an
English-speaking one imposed upon the Japanese language. Gonna start
working through Genki I now that I've gotten through this book.

romhack that is technically interesting and has some cool ideas and fun
levels, but suffers enormously from difficulty curve irregularity / bugs
/ poor level design. I found myself frequently getting softlocked, dying
randomly due to weird level geometry problems, having issues with the
camera, etc, and I eventually made it a game to see how many stars I
could get by BLJing past walls instead of actually earning them. I had
fun with it, but I couldn't manage to 100% it because there were just
some stars that were so broken that I got too frustrated to continue
playing. It made me appreciate how relatively not broken the original
game was, and how important beta testing is for these sorts of games.

vs Luigi (Chillindude829)</a></i> Watched this after playing a set at Shine
2017 against a luigi and realizing that I didn't have a firm
understanding of my goals in this matchup (shine doesn't lead to
anything, grab doesn't lead to anything, so what are you going for in
neutral against luigi? What's your gameplan? I ended up just going for
random hits and getting steamrolled). Takeaways: uptilt vs nairs, dash
attack is a common mixup situation (nair out jump out etc), usually
avoid midrange (close/far is good), Disjoints are good (uptilt, falling
upair). Being above luigi is very good. Empty drill into fullhop is
pretty good because you can punish grab attempts with falling upair.

with a reclusive developer "Magus" who moves into their apartment to
help them with the documentary. However, it turns out that the person
that claimed to be Magus was actually somebody impersonating Magus,
having done so for months and knowing intimate information that
"verified" their identity with other dev team members. Nobody knows who
this person was, or how they knew so much about Magus and the internal
details of the development team, and everybody is freaked out about it.

which uses a hardcoded goals hierarchy rather than learning it all via
deep reinforcement learning. These fall under what I call "Watson
Syndrome" where they are capable of winning because of their superior
"biology" rather than actually outplaying their opponents, and as such I
don't think these are particularly useful as training tools (I.e. A
"winning position" for the AI is not necessarily winning for a human, if
such a situation requires something like frame perfect reaction time,
and attempting to emulate its playstyle would likely be extremely
foolish, unlike with Deep Blue or AlphaGo. For games with a biological
element [Melee, Dota, Jeopardy] emulating realistic biology is important
before you can announce "triumph" over human players.)

not have - I have a copy of it and I'm using it for kanji I'm having

<i>Berlitz Complete Japanese</i> A good series of dialogues to introduce
basic Japanese grammar (I'm still very much a beginner but I imagine
this is all N5 level). The dialogues are charming enough to keep you
reasonably engaged - I found myself more amused than I ought to be
listening to Harrison-san's antics, which I think is a good thing for
this type of resource. The dialogues are completely in Japanese, which
is what I wanted, but things become confusing if you can't figure out
what words mean so this might be worth supplementing with another
textbook, a dictionary, or the workbook. There's some weirdness
(pronouncing wo particle actually as "wo" sometimes) but overall good to
listen to if you want to practice listening/speaking
</p>

<p>
<i>Introductory Statistics with R</i> A book that I think is best suited
either with a teacher or with another, more traditional, statistics
textbook. Using R has proven very useful, but the book was heavy with
jargon that it did not explain properly, and I frequently felt lost
despite making flashcards and reading very carefully. Certain concepts
are vaguely explained or not explained at all, and you're expected to
have a minimum level of knowledge that I felt was inappropriate given
that it also explained really basic stuff like factorials. Overall a
useful book that added a good tool to my toolkit, but one that
frequently had me googling things for clarification.

<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria_(manga)">Aria</a></i> Slow, relaxing,
with some basic scifi concepts, works better as a manga than an anime
due to pacing. Fits the genre of "utopia that isn't a utopia", everyone
just sort of lazily goes about their days and most of the story is
literally about being able to slow down and admire the scenery around
you (MC's entire personality type, as well as the job of the Primas).

spot for violating suspension of disbelief and then trying to explain it
away using crazy theories. Reminds me a lot of the
"<a href="http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Matrix_in_a_Matrix_theory">Matrix in a
Matrix</a>" theory, where people plugged the ridiculous left-field plot
hole of Matrix Reloaded as evidence that, since Neo can use powers in
the "real world", it's likely not the real world - just another layer of
fabrication that Neo pulled his punches in because he didn't believe he
had powers in there. Probably false, but a fun way to engage with plot
holes!

<i>Koe no Katachi (2016)</i> - I think as good of a film adaptation as I
could have reasonably expected from condensing this rather long story
into a two hour film. Pacing issues that were not present in the manga,
parts felt extremely rushed due to cutting out some smaller arcs to make
time. Characters didn't have enough time to properly develop into
believable characters with the exception of the main character, again a
byproduct of lack of time. Where this film shines is sound direction, it
uses silence and white noise extremely well, which compliments the films
themes (hearing vs listening / blocking out the world / etc). The
animation is fantastic as well, Kyoto Animation delivers as you might
expect. Overall not quite as good as the manga adaptation, but not bad
by any means.
