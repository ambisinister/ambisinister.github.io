Hello!

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-content">
<p>
The content on this website is mostly my writings on various topics like
video games, Cognitive Science, electronics, and a bunch of other
tangentially related topics. In short, it's a bunch of essays written by
myself, about my projects or about topics I'm just generally interested
in. At the moment it's a bit bare, but I'm actively working on a bunch
of stuff so that should change in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Format-wise, I went with a website like this mostly out of my explicit
dislike for blogs, which I think are more analogous to a newspaper than
they are to, say, a book. I quite like Gwern's idea of
"<a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content">Long Content</a>", and in
general a lot of the content I'm interested in writing is meant to still
be readable in 5/10/20 years.

<h2 id="learning-by-accumulation">Learning By Accumulation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-learning-by-accumulation">
<p>
This is a sort of meta-skill I developed during my college years that
has served me extremely well up to now. Before I started learning to do
this, I would think of project ideas and more or less immediately
discard them, since I didn't yet have the relevant skillset to
accomplish it and felt that acquiring that skillset would be too much of
an investment. Something like "make a machine learning classifier for
seeding tournament brackets" felt impossible to me, since I was under
the erroneous assumption that I would need to learn mountains of machine
learning to "become worthy" of doing a project on machine learning. In
short, I felt that I didn't deserve to use tools that I had not yet
mastered completely.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, I realized, that's not really the case! Becoming functional and
mediocre at pretty much anything is within reach for pretty much anyone,
and if you're doing it for the sake of a project and not a career then
it's often practical to only acquire what you need to accomplish your
goal. This can often lead you to a more passionate interest in your
subject that you otherwise would have had (i.e. making something cool to
gauge your interest in a subject, then deciding that it was extremely
cool and learning more about it).
</p>

<p>
The nice thing about this is that your skillset and knowledge don't go
away after you finish your project. By doing many things, you learn to
do many things, and thereby gain access to even more things you wouldn't
have even thought of had you not done the first thing. As they say, once
you're given a hammer, nails start popping up all over the place.
</p>

<p>
It seems like a pretty obvious thing to say, but you won't believe how
often I see people place this sort of self-imposed barrier to action
upon themselves. People who show up to SSBM tournaments after spending a
year practicing by themselves, since they didn't feel "good enough to
play with real players", or people who refuse to do anything vaguely
math-related since they're afraid of numbers.
</p>

<p>
Also important to note is that learning in this way will often put you
face-to-face with failure. It's important to realize that this is okay!
Having consistent output is more important than making sure all your
output is good, since you have no obligation to share every single
failure you have. Trying something too hard and messing up still nets
you experience points in the real world, and as Neal Stephenson put it:
"hey, at least a wild-goose chase gives you some exercise."

<h2 id="disagreeing-with-me">Disagreeing with Me</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-disagreeing-with-me">
<p>
You may eventually find a point on which you disagree with me on,
perhaps extremely strongly. For these events, please consult the
following directions:
</p>

<p>
For smaller disagreements, I would suggest just confronting me about
them. I have a stronger interest in holding accurate beliefs than
defending my own beliefs, so there's a very real chance that you'll be
able to change my mind, and even if you're certain I won't be able to
change yours I would probably appreciate the opportunity to challenge my
own beliefs and make them more accurate. You can do this at virtually
any time, and I will not request time to prepare myself since if I need
preparation then I probably don't have a very solid grasp of why I
believe the thing anyways.
</p>

<p>
For larger disagreements, we can settle it like gentlemen/women and have
a good, honest duel over it. I propose a set of three games, each best
of three. one in a game of my own choosing (most likely Super Smash
Brothers Melee), one game of your choosing, and a game in the middle
(let's say, rock paper scissors). For these disagreements, I suggest a
training period of one month in which I can learn your game and you can
learn mine, and at the end of the month we duel and the winner would be
declared the victor, being definitively and objectively correct at
whatever squabble we were having. I am reasonably competent at many
games, but I am not amazing at any of them, so I find this to be a fair
victory condition.
</p>

<p>
For the biggest, most impossible to resolve disagreements, I am willing
to accept a challenge to a fair and honorable boxing match to the death.
Please only use this option for the most passionate beliefs you have,
those because of which my existence completely invalidates yours. I
reserve the right to tap out at any time (with the condition that you
are declared right, of course). However, this will require a full year
of training, in which I will have enough time to get in decent shape,
learn some sort of martial arts, and come to terms with the fragility of
life. Like I mentioned, though, most things probably would be better
suited for the previous condition with the three video games, so please
choose those as a default option.
