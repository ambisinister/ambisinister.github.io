			<h1>About/Contact</h1>
			<p>	Hello! </p>
			<p>I'm a Cognitive Science major at Yale College. My major focuses on the development of Human Expertise</p>
			<p>I like computers! I occasionally make techy things, and I currently work as a Student Tech for 
			Yale Information Technology Services where I mostly repair hardware. I like programming.</p>
			<p>I speak English and Spanish, and I'm working on learning Japanese.</p> 
			<p>I love self-improvement, so a lot of my interests revolve around competition or 
			self-betterment (Melee, Chess, Reading, etc etc.) The most important philosophical 
			idea around which I base my life is the idea of making yourself better than you were yesterday. </p>
			<p>If you want to talk to me about academics or any of my more serious projects, feel free to 
			shoot me an email at eryk.banatt@yale.edu</p>
			<p> If you want to talk to me about Melee, friend me on 
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ambisinisterSSBM" target="_blank">facebook</a> and send me a message. 
			I love talking about Melee! </p>
