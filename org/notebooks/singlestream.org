Riichi Mahjong Scoring by StarPlaysMahjong

Shibukawa Nanba of Sakura Knights made the methods in this video, which were translated by this person.

Memorizing the table is super tedious and intimidating. There are shorthands which make it easier.

Throwing three things away to start: pinfu/chiitoitsu, dealer scores, fu. You can learn a basic way without these and then fill in the gaps afterwards

When you win with ron you say 1 number (what they pay), when you win with tsumo you say 2 numbers (nondealer/dealer). When the dealer tsumos everybody pays the high values.

step 1: hands above mangan. These are easy because they're only with han and dont deal with fu.

|   han | ron       |  type | tsumo        |
|-------+-----------+-------+--------------|
|   4-5 | mangan    |  8000 | (2000-4000)  |
|   6-7 | haneman   | 12000 | (3000-6000)  |
|  8-10 | baiman    | 16000 | (4000-8000)  |
| 11-12 | sanbaiman | 24000 | (6000-12000) |
|   13+ | yakuman   | 32000 | (8000-16000) |

It starts at 8000 and goes up by 1.5x for each tier.

step 2: hands below mangan

most of the time it follows this table

| han |        open | closed |                          tsumo |
|-----+-------------+--------+--------------------------------|
|   1 |        1000 |   1300 |                        300-500 |
|   2 |        2000 |   2600 |                       500-1000 |
|   3 |        3900 |   5200 |                      1000-2000 |
|   4 | mangan/7700 | mangan | 2000-4000 / mangan (2000-3900) |

39 is "san kyu" which sounds like "thank you" 

This is a super simple flowchart. If above 4 han, use step 1 table. If below, check open/closed/tsumo and use the appropriate column.

step 3: honba / riichi sticks:

every time the dealer wins there's 300 points extra for ron per honba, 100 points extra for tsumo per honba (because there are three players other than the winner), 1 honba added every time theres a dealer win or draw
honba reset if nondealer wins (draw doesnt reset)

riichi sticks carry over from drawn games, increases score for winner but not included in point calculation (don't include those when you say the point value out loud, 4 han mangan is still 2000-4000 even with two riichi sticks.

practice hands

1: tanyao dora 1 2000
2: riichi ippeiko tsumo 1000-2000 (4000)
3: riichi tsumo aka 1 dora 3 haneman 3000-6000 (12000+300 honba)
4: riichi sanshoku 5200

Step 4: pinfu

pinfu has weird exceptions.
tsumo for pinfu is 1 han but way fewer points
closed ron bonus is negated, pinfu ron is the same as open ron
pinfu tsumo 4 han is not a mangan (!)

new table

| han |     pinfu ron | pinfu tsumo            |
|-----+---------------+------------------------|
|   1 |          1000 | n/a                    |
|   2 |          2000 | 400-700 (total 1500)   |
|   3 |          3900 | 700-1300 (total 2600)  |
|   4 | mangan (7700) | 1300-2600 (total 5200) |
|   5 |        mangan | mangan                 |

you see pinfu ron behaves as open even if closed

step 5: chiitoitsu

| han | score            |
|-----+------------------|
|   1 | n/a              |
|   2 | 1600 (400-800)   |
|   3 | 3200 (800-1600)  |
|   4 | 6400 (1600-3200) |
|   5 | mangan           |

everything nice and easily doubles
4 han seven pairs is not mangan

step 6: do it again for dealer

above mangan is just multiplied by 1.5, with everybody paying high value for tsumo

|   han | ron       |  type | tsumo     |
|-------+-----------+-------+-----------|
|   4-5 | mangan    | 12000 | 4000 all  |
|   6-7 | haneman   | 18000 | 6000 all  |
|  8-10 | baiman    | 24000 | 8000 all  |
| 11-12 | sanbaiman | 36000 | 12000 all |
|   13+ | yakuman   | 48000 | 16000 all |

dealer below mangan

for tsumo, its just the high value from non-dealer tsumo
for rons, it's mostly 1.5x nondealer with some annoying exceptions (2900 5800)

| han | 7 pairs ron | pinfu / open ron | closed ron |
|-----+-------------+------------------+------------|
|   1 |         n/a |             1500 |       2000 |
|   2 |        2400 |             2900 |       3900 |
|   3 |        4800 |             5800 |       7700 |
|   4 |        9600 |   mangan (11600) | mangan     |

dealer 3 han closed ron is always 7700

This also produces an easy ish flowchart.

practice hands 2

1: tanyao pinfu riichi tsumo 
nondealer: 1300-2600
dealer: 2600 all

2: riichi chiitoitsu aka 1
nondealer: 6400
dealer: 9600

3: riichi ippeiko tanyao pinfu dora 2
nondealer: haneman 12000
dealer: haneman 18000

step 7: learning fu

hands start at 20 and gain for waits / groups / winning
round to nearest 10 except for chiitoi which is fixed at 25
closed ron is +10 fu so hands that are 30 get bumped to 40 (hence diff tables)

basically: 20 fu is pinfu numbers, 25 fu is chiitoi numbers
30 fu is open ron numbers, 40 fu is closed ron / pinfu tsumo minus one han
50 fu is seven pairs numbers minus one han

general rule: 40+ fu you can add 1 han and divide fu by 2
2 han 50 fu = 3 han 25 fu (chiitoi 3 han)
40 fu is the same numbers as 20 fu (pinfu) but minus a han

20+group+wait+winning, round up to 10
the magic number is 12.

group fu
triplet gives 2 fu. 2x if ankou, 2x if terminal, 4x if kan.
yakuhai pair is 2 fu

wait fu
kanchan/penchan/tanki is 2 fu
shanpon doesnt give fu (already gives fu for triplet)

winning fu
tsumo is 2 fu
closed ron is 10 fu
open ron is 0 fu


when do you count fu?
- a kan
- at least two triplets
- closed terminal/honor triplet

fu is only important if you get to 12 fu or higher.
fu adding spots:
nothing - 30
closed ron - 40 (pinfu tsumo minus one han)
+12 fu - 40
closed ron +12 fu - 50 (seven pairs minus one han)
+22 fu - 50

practice hands 3:

1: riichi tsumo (only +10 fu from 9 triplet tsumo) 
nondealer: 500-1000 
dealer: 1000 all

2: tsumo tanyao pinfu iipeiko
nondealer: 1300-2600 (1600-2900 w/ honba)
dealer: 2600 all (2900 all w/ honba)

3: tanyao dora 1
fu: triplet 8 (2) closed kan 8 (16) kenchan wait (2) tsumo (2)
+22 fu so 50 fu
nondealer: 800-1600
dealer: 1600 all

4: tanyao aka 1 dora 1
fu: open kan 3 (8) kenchan wait (2) tsumo (2) = 12 fu
40 fu
nondealer: 1300-2600
dealer: 2600 all

I don't really feel like doing the rest of these practice problems im sure ill get practice over time.

huge fu you should just pull out the table (lol) but you can memorize these too.
