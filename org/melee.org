I'm a fox main that goes by "Ambisinister" whose active region is
Connecticut (although I occasionally play in NJ). I play green fox and I
like aggressive, technical play. I was ranked 10th on the
[[http://i.imgur.com/4D8oy4U.png][Connecticut Winter 2015-2016 Season
Power Rankings]] but I went inactive because of school.

(My tag is a little long, but it's supposed to be a joke -- Ambisinister
is the antonym of ambidextrous and literally means "unskilled or
uncoordinated with both hands." Sometimes I shorten this to "Ambi" and I
like entering locals with silly joke tags.)

I'm also somewhat of a commentator - I provide commentary at locals
every so often, and I commentated pools with

**** Combo Videos

In 2015 I made combo videos each month as a sort of scrapbook of how my
year went.
([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLczW29iRM_QfiZamO_u-G-yMpazId1p9L][A
playlist containing them can be seen here]]). At the end of the year I
took the best of each month and made a
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28XxRhViIZU][2015 highlight reel]]
which was generally pretty well received although the framerate and
video quality could've been a bit nicer.

I have also made
[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLczW29iRM_Qf4LcgEDNjnJQ9w_up3CcIW][a
few other]] combo videos, mostly for Smash @ Yale

[[file:images/syalelogo.jpg]]
I am the founder and President of the [[][Yale Undergraduate Super Smash
Brothers Club]], typically shortened to "Smash @ Yale." We have a
reasonably large regular playerbase and meet once a week in William
Harkness Hall. Officially, we support every entry in the smash series,
but in practice the vast majority of our playerbase plays Melee, with a
little Project M crossover.

Yale has a [[][Melee Games]] team, which placed third in New England in
the Fall 2015 season.

In 2015 our regular members starred in our
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaO7U-YUvg][2015 Combo Video]] which
featured the following.

-  Paul Kim -- Papples
-  Sam Klebanoff -- Teamwork
-  Daniel Chavenert -- Dan
-  Benjamin Tong -- Real
-  Eryk Banatt -- Ambisinister
-  Lyndon Ji -- Walnut

It took a little under four months to compile the clips, edit them,
synchronize them to music, and so on. This project took many hours and
made me extremely sick of listening to the same songs over and over
again but was fairly well-received upon release, appearing in

"...one can only admire the dedication these fine players have put on
display. Excellent combos, and filled with tons of personality..." -
Melee it On Me

"The bar has been set high already." - Melee it On Me

"...this vid was incredible. I love vids that show off a bunch of
players from a particular scene. The clips were great." -Tdude

"Very exciting and refreshing. I liked their playstyles. [Papples']
Reverse ftilt was reminiscent of the mango/lucky/alex19 combo vids."
-Viridian-Genesis

"Great vid. Now you've inspired me to really put in some work on the
Rice smash scene." -Ge0rge249

"Does the person who made this video play itg lol" -v4extreme

These days, I've taken to making
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVSbSB1ccTA][Yale]]
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtGv4DBO5ic][Highlights]] Videos since
they don't require a player to be on the team, meaning clip collection
happens much quicker and everybody in our club can get excited about
them.
