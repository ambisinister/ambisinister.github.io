** Dress Code

We want you to be comfortable! We're going with "Semi Formal" as the dress code, so wear something you would be excited to be photographed wearing. The important part is that it allows you to feel like yourself: whether that's something traditional, something fashionable, something gender non-conforming, or otherwise. Just try to avoid white dresses and shorts please!
