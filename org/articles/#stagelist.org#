#+TITLE: SSBM Stagelist


* All The World's a Stage: On The Stagelist in SSBM

** Abstract

We explore the matchups of Super Smash Brothers Melee based on survey responses about matchups stratified by stages. We recieved n=x responses to a survey asking participants to give matchup ratios on each stage vs the high tier characters. We use this to explore the idea of adding a banned stage in Best of 5, as well as how closely the list approximates the new SSBM Tier List.

** Introduction

A combination of the lack of in-person tournaments and the rise of Project Slippi as the predomant way to play accessible, low-stakes matches have led to an unprecidented rise in netplay tournaments, many of which are free to enter. With all these new, easy-to-run, low-overhead tournaments, a more-frequent-than-usual discourse on alternative rulesets has started popping up. Because tournaments don't require paying for a venue to hold and to attend, running a tournament which runs an alternative, experimental ruleset has never been easier. Some of these ideas, like Frozen Stadium, have been met with near-ubiquitous praise. [[https://twitter.com/MeleeStatsPod/status/1382741229725757440][Others]] have not been met with as much excitement.  

One idea which has primarily been floated by spacie players is the idea of adding a ban in best of five sets, as they currently exist for best of three sets. The argument goes that most characters have a stage that makes the matchup lopsided, and that a ban in a longer set would make most matchups less dependent on counterpick stages. 

Whether or not this subjective argument carries any weight, as far as the history of ruleset changes go, is not terribly important to it's adoption. Melee players will inevitably adopt a ruleset which can be feasibly run at tournaments which the most people consider to be fun. Still, though, it would be nice to explore how much the ban in best of five changes the meta, if at all. 

** The Tier List

In lieu of a global ranking in 2020, Panda Global elected to revive the tier list, which had not been updated in five or six years. The resulting list was relatively inoffensive, as far as the high tier characters go, and the list met minimal criticism from players who use a character above yoshi on the list. 

However, like most things in our lovely community, there was substantial criticism about the list about the process the list was made. Most notably, it was done by asking top players to create a list of every character, rather than asking each player to submit a list of their main character's matchups and then inferring a list from there. The reason for this is pretty straightforward; the list needs to have weak characters on it, and nobody who plays those characters plays those weak characters in tournaments (with some exceptions). 

Still, though, most players are a lot more competent at assessing the attributes of their own character, rather than making a judgment about how good mid tiers are against other mid tiers. It would be fun to see how a list generated this way compares to a list made via the global aggregate method. 

*** Generating a Matchup Chart

*** From Matchup Chart to Tier List

There are two ways to approach generating a tier list: assuming equal character distribution and assuming a specific character distribution

**** Even Distribution (Character vs Cast)

**** Special Distribution (Character vs Meta)

Keep in mind that the distribution here might be different; being good vs jigglypuff might have been more valuable for the tier list during hungrybox's reign at number one, compared to now where he is considered less important to beat to win majors. In both of these scenarios, the actual distribution of characters hasn't really changed, but the relative value of beating a specific character 

*** Inferring a distribution from a list

<<if the list doesn't look much like the original list, maybe run some code to infer the distribution which makes the emergent list the most important>>
