** Intro

I recently did a little [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/Bracket_Stamina.pdf][writeup]] on an iterative game I came up with called "Bracket Stamina", a multiplayer version of the [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01427v1.pdf][Kelly Coin Flip Game]]. The basic idea behind this game is: you are placed in an elimination bracket with a number of points. Your opponent has some number of points, which you can see. You and your opponent wager a number of points -- whoever picks the higher number will advance to the next round, but they will lose all of the points they wager. In this sense, you are incentivized to win as narrowly as possible, to conserve resources for later rounds. 

** Difficulty of Bracket vs Seed

There is a common misconception among competitors that, broadly, lower seeds are harder and higher seeds are easy. 

** Probability to Win with Perturbed Seed
