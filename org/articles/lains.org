While /Evangelion/ highlights the technology of the animation medium
itself to call our notions of reality into question, /Serial
Experiments Lain/ presents its viewers with an animated world in which
technology, specifically the computer, both creates and deconstructs
reality. While the EVA in /Evangelion/ is essentially anthropomorphized,
a concrete Other that is, initially at least, a necessary part of the
characters’ identities, the “machine” in /Lain/ is invisible, part of a
world known as the Wired in which the machine not only supports but
literally constructs identity. This premise leads both characters and
viewers on a darkly surreal adventure into a virtual house of mirrors
where identities shift, disappear, and reformulate and where death and
life are refigured to create a disorienting and disquieting vision of
a very near future.
