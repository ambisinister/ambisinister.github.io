* Monthly Links

This page is mostly a log in which I keep links to things I've read,
made, done, etc. It's separated by month, along with my goals for the
next month, and should be end up being in reverse chronological order

** 2018

*** July 2018
**** Brief Updates
- *Sent a V3 Problem* Didn't get a video recording of it, but I sent an interesting slab problem at The Gravity Vault in Randor, PA. In my send I got stuck on the last move for maybe three full minutes before getting past it with a weird coordination mantle + pistol squat move, which I felt really good about even though it suggests my move into the last move was probably not super optimal.
- *Sent another, different V3 Problem* Video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dzvj-iehyW9g][here]], another relatively easy problem which I abused my height to make easier. I want to send this cleaner (as I did with that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4rmQWE4jCbY][super weird teal V2]] that everyone at my gym hates, myself included). I really liked the mini cut-loose move near the end but I think this climb would be easier with better footwork especially after the third hand move (flag is unnecessary). I think a footswap after the fifth hand move -> move right foot to hold right next to it skips the need for cutting loose, but I could be misunderstanding how good the holds are from that position from this video. Overall I think definitely a relatively easy v3 which I think is appropriate for what I consider my current level at climbing (V2+/V3-)
- *Practiced a bunch for Evo 2018* I'm very excited for this event and I think I'm in pretty good form for it - I'm unsure if I'll do well or not but I'm looking forward to playing a lot of great melee with strong players and having a good time in Las Vegas.

**** Goals for August
- *Play Well at Evo 2018, get hours in against new, strong players*
- *Send two more V3s, one of which must be a roof/overhang* 
- *Cut weight back down to 150-153 range*
- *Resume work on programming work*
- *Begin work on secret SSBM video project*

**** Things I've Made

- [[http://www.planetbanatt.net/articles/omron.html][How Variable are Omron Scales?]] I got back up to 160 so I ran some measurements on my bodyfat / muscle percentages and they were much better than the last time I was this weight, which is very exciting and motivating
- [[https://twitter.com/ThePGstats/status/1014931922299088898][MPGR Summer Top 50 Ballot]] After a bunch of discussion, PGR ended up sticking with the ballot system instead of using the algorithmic ranking. I was a panelist this season, and spent a good amount of time making this ballot (which will remain hidden to avoid external pressure influencing my vote). 
- [[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/289261916][MPGR Roundtable Part 2: #40-31]] I appear as a guest on Panda Global's Twitch show discussing the summerrank top 50, along with Aiden, Appel, Gimmedatwheat, Edwinbudding, and PracticalTAS.

***** Video

I thought his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Db9sycdSkngA][Treasure Planet]] video was great, and this is his most recent work which I found to be impressively novel and interesting. Definitely worth a watch.

*** June 2018 
**** Goals for July
- *Send another V3 Problem* I have one that I'm working on but I am worried they will take it down before I get the last move, so if I can't get it by the end of the month then I'll need to find something else
- *Practice an unreasonable amount for Evo 2018* It's probably because I can no longer take Melee for granted and play it every day, but I haven't felt this motivated for a tournament in a very long time. I really want to perform well so I've been practicing a lot and I don't want to let this motivation fizzle out before the event.
- *Work on projects when you have time* I have a lot of things in the works, among which the things I have not finished from months ago, but my priorities have temporarily shifted for now so I think if I finish any real projects in the next month I'll view it as a bonus rather than an explicit goal.
**** Things I have Made
- [[http://planetbanatt.net][Overhauled personal website]] I now generate this entire website from emacs org files; going back and transforming all my html documents to org files was sort of a pain but luckily with pandoc it didn't take longer than an afternoon - the rough part was wrangling with the org html export, which I eventually managed to nail down. It looks cool now! Still some work to be done but not bad.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsdz2mTnhfM][V3 Boulder Problem]] interesting mantle -> mantle thing going on in this problem; it feels a little easy for a V3 but I'm not complaining since it let me meet my goal for this month! I've now completed every V2 problem in the gym so I'm currently focusing on climbing them cleanly / V3 problems / waiting for new problems
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYAW1Edfy290][V2 Slab Problem]] really cool problem at a gym I don't usually go to
- [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1013181502375563264][Fountain of Dreams is Cool Now]] stupid movement idea I came up with on this stage

**** Things I have Consumed
- [[https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/tools-for-rock-climbing-training/the-making-of-a-rock-prodigy/][Tools for Rock Climbing Training: The Making of a 'Rockprodigy']] a lot of really great quotes in here, I'm starting to get really motivated for improvement in climbing and melee so I've been spending a lot less time on projects and a lot more time on practice.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DVkFSVBL4AI8][Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition]] 2 hour presentation by ZFG of OoT glitches that are not useful in speedruns. I enjoyed it a lot!
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoySLq4y-c8M][Sub Float - Quetzalcoatl]] Melee's preimere Peach Frame Data person documents a setup for floating lower than ground float height, allowing for +4 nairs. Not super useful since setup burns your doublejump making it quite dangerous, but almost baffling that the game went this long without anyone discovering this until now.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DY99Wj-NStok][Choco Mountain: The History of Mario Kart 64's Most Infamous Track]] w e a t h e r t e n k o


*** May 2018
**** Goals for June
- Send a v3 boulder problem
- Make big changes to website formatting using emacs HTML export
- Complete posts I keep postponing work on
- Make it very straightforward to export new things to this site now that everything is centralized in emacs (!!)
**** Things I have Made

*** April 2018
**** Goals for May
     - *Turn 23*
     - *Complete Bracket Stamina post* (this has gone on for too long as it is, since I keep encountering cool things abour it, and I made less progress than I would've liked on it despite working on it for ~20ish hours this month, but a lot of that is due to the fact that I am learning emacs through this project; I think I'm mostly completed with interesting things to encounter so I expect to be completed by mid may)
     - *Become very comfortable with emacs*; a friend of mine showed me his emacs setup and I realized that I had virtually the same workflow except strewn across 15 different programs and within two weeks of using it I am back/surpassing to my old productivity speed despite regularly pausing to remember how to perform the "copy" command. Fully expect to sink 300+ hours into configuring this program within the next year but as it stands I am already hooked on it. 
     - *Begin working on next coding project* surprise for now.
     - *Complete some stray writing projects*

-  Finish Bracket Stamina project and Spaced repetition post; finish
   reading Proofs and Refutations; make anki cards on US History; Start
   working through Linear Algebra Done Right and
   [[http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/anjp/textbook.pdf][this]].
-  SSBM: continue working on implementing aerial drift, specifically out
   of short hop; work on making platform punishes against fastfallers
   more consistent
-  Practice some substantial amount of time this month learning to play
   guitar, figure out some way to track hours practiced (for this and
   for other things)

   SSBM / writing

Health

-  finished a two month trial period for
   [[https://examine.com/supplements/bacopa-monnieri/][Bacopa
   Monnieri]]. Ended up observing a rise in correct answers for new +
   young anki cards of about 8%, and no change in mature cards. I didn't
   do any blinding, and would probably have to revisit this if I wanted
   to explore it deeply in any capacity. I don't really feel like bacopa
   gave me anything super valuable given the magnitude of the effect, so
   I've discontinued taking it (although I might consider taking it
   again if I ever decide to become a student again). Funny to think
   about how effectively you can replace the use of short term memory
   with good external capturing like anki or Evernote.

SSBM

-  spent virtually my entire month practicing backwards aerial drift.
   Entered a tournament and placed pretty well despite feeling pretty
   off tech-skill wise. Feel good about practice paying off somewhat for
   me.

Misc

-  Decided against adding an RSS feed, since adding one for a static
   website is more trouble than it's worth and I have a far too small
   readership that would ever use it.
-  Met most of my goals from last month (only finished 2 books but did a
   lot of reading), still need some calibration but enough of my time
   went towards practicing melee that I had a slightly below average
   level of productivity

A pretty interesting look at how different teams perform at different

Trading - Ambition, Deception, Honor, Redemption: The story of the
biggest heist in Eve's history]] Half chilling, half fascinating - Eve
Online scammer details how he ran a ponzi scheme disguised as a
fraudulent trading corporation in-game, eventually leading to him making
away with 30 billion isk (A few thousand dollars). There's a lot of
really amusing anecdotes in here (he claims he didn't sell the isk for
real money because he didn't want to break the terms of service, he
mentions the playerbase revolting after the moderators returned money
from a different scam, and that he had intended to return as much of it
as possible before being mistakenly banned and changing his mind upon
the reversal), and it reads like a wild criminal testimonial for someone
who knows he's not going to face any repercussions. In the end he blew
the whistle on another scammer, the EVE Interstellar Bank, a scam that
netted /that/ scammer 750 billion isk (~$80k USD).

"those who did not make specific requests, and instead asked open-ended
questions like "how can I trust you?" and "how do I know this is for
real?"--these were future investors. They were asking me to persuade
them. They wanted to believe."

"People who posted on the forums seemed to have a negative attitude
about everything. Rather than being a cross-section of the Eve populace,
the forums were populated by a group disparagingly known as "the forum
superstars"--people who spent all their time on the forums instead of
actually playing the game. Not only did they have a fame and influence
far out of proportion to their playing abilities, they were accused of
getting special treatment from the administrators of the Eve servers.
But it was their persistent scorn for anyone making anything new--and
their seeming inability to make their own positive contributions to the
game--that maintained the ordinary players' low regard for them."

"In the end, I decided that the only value in having stolen all of that
isk was not the isk itself, but the stealing of it. I wanted to see if I
could do the impossible, and I did it. The more I pondered the actual
value of isk, the more I saw that the only people who really valued it
were the ones who had earned it themselves. Despite Eve being a game,
they had put real work into it. Many of them had spent three years
shooting rocks and hauling modules around to earn that isk, and now it
would be gone."

"Only now did I appreciate just how insidious a scam could be. I had
thought the isk meant nothing to me. That it was just a means to an end,
a score to beat. But now I was willing to wreak devastation upon all of
my investors just to hold onto it. The scam had scammed me. It stole my
concern for others and replaced it with gluttony. I was disgusted. I
lied. I cheated people. I used people to help me scam their friends. I
was the cause of widespread bankruptcy. But the most damning thing of
all? I think I can live with it, and if I had it to do all over again, I
would. To my surprise, a guilty conscience was a small price to pay for
thirty billion isk. So I will learn to live with it, because I can live
with it."

Trauma, and Human Resilience - Have We Underestimated the Human Capacity

paper which suggests that most people are actually impressively
resilient after aversive events. Because so many people that show up to
clinicians after bad things happen are in need of clinicians to help
them, the prevailing view was that when bad things happen to people they
usually need time to grieve. However, the sample size was very
self-selecting here, and exploring more "normal" baselines suggest its
possible that on average people are pretty good about staying functional
through traumatic events.

the structure and despite it being a little wonky at first it made the

[[http://sm64hacks.com/hack.php?id=59][SM64: The Last Impact]] a fun
romhack that is technically interesting and has some cool ideas and fun
levels, but suffers enormously from difficulty curve irregularity / bugs

randomly due to weird level geometry problems, having issues with the
camera, etc, and I eventually made it a game to see how many stars I
could get by BLJing past walls instead of actually earning them. I had
fun with it, but I couldn't manage to 100% it because there were just
some stars that were so broken that I got too frustrated to continue
playing. It made me appreciate how relatively not broken the original
game was, and how important beta testing is for these sorts of games.

understanding of my goals in this matchup (shine doesn't lead to
anything, grab doesn't lead to anything, so what are you going for in
neutral against luigi? What's your gameplan? I ended up just going for
random hits and getting steamrolled). Takeaways: uptilt vs nairs, dash
attack is a common mixup situation (nair out jump out etc), usually
avoid midrange (close/far is good), Disjoints are good (uptilt, falling
upair). Being above luigi is very good. Empty drill into fullhop is
pretty good because you can punish grab attempts with falling upair.

help them with the documentary. However, it turns out that the person
that claimed to be Magus was actually somebody impersonating Magus,
having done so for months and knowing intimate information that
"verified" their identity with other dev team members. Nobody knows who
this person was, or how they knew so much about Magus and the internal
details of the development team, and everybody is freaked out about it.

which uses a hardcoded goals hierarchy rather than learning it all via
deep reinforcement learning. These fall under what I call "Watson
Syndrome" where they are capable of winning because of their superior
"biology" rather than actually outplaying their opponents, and as such I
don't think these are particularly useful as training tools (I.e. A
"winning position" for the AI is not necessarily winning for a human, if
such a situation requires something like frame perfect reaction time,
and attempting to emulate its playstyle would likely be extremely
foolish, unlike with Deep Blue or AlphaGo. For games with a biological
element [Melee, Dota, Jeopardy] emulating realistic biology is important
before you can announce "triumph" over human players.)

/Berlitz Complete Japanese/ A good series of dialogues to introduce
basic Japanese grammar (I'm still very much a beginner but I imagine
this is all N5 level). The dialogues are charming enough to keep you
reasonably engaged - I found myself more amused than I ought to be
listening to Harrison-san's antics, which I think is a good thing for
this type of resource. The dialogues are completely in Japanese, which
is what I wanted, but things become confusing if you can't figure out
what words mean so this might be worth supplementing with another
textbook, a dictionary, or the workbook. There's some weirdness
(pronouncing wo particle actually as "wo" sometimes) but overall good to
listen to if you want to practice listening/speaking

/Introductory Statistics with R/ A book that I think is best suited
either with a teacher or with another, more traditional, statistics
textbook. Using R has proven very useful, but the book was heavy with
jargon that it did not explain properly, and I frequently felt lost
despite making flashcards and reading very carefully. Certain concepts
are vaguely explained or not explained at all, and you're expected to
have a minimum level of knowledge that I felt was inappropriate given
that it also explained really basic stuff like factorials. Overall a
useful book that added a good tool to my toolkit, but one that
frequently had me googling things for clarification.

"[[http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Matrix_in_a_Matrix_theory][Matrix in a
Matrix]]" theory, where people plugged the ridiculous left-field plot
hole of Matrix Reloaded as evidence that, since Neo can use powers in
the "real world", it's likely not the real world - just another layer of
fabrication that Neo pulled his punches in because he didn't believe he
had powers in there. Probably false, but a fun way to engage with plot
holes!

/Koe no Katachi (2016)/ - I think as good of a film adaptation as I
could have reasonably expected from condensing this rather long story
into a two hour film. Pacing issues that were not present in the manga,
parts felt extremely rushed due to cutting out some smaller arcs to make
time. Characters didn't have enough time to properly develop into
believable characters with the exception of the main character, again a
byproduct of lack of time. Where this film shines is sound direction, it
uses silence and white noise extremely well, which compliments the films
themes (hearing vs listening / blocking out the world / etc). The
animation is fantastic as well, Kyoto Animation delivers as you might
expect. Overall not quite as good as the manga adaptation, but not bad
by any means.
