#+TITLE: Monthly Links
* Monthly Links

This page is mostly a log in which I keep links to things I've read,
made, done, etc. It's separated by month, along with my goals for the
next month, and should be end up being in reverse chronological order
** 2024
*** July 2024
**** Things I Made
     - [[https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance/pull/935][Added phi-3-small support to guidance]] My first open source contribution!! I learned a lot about tokenizers working on this project.
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/mla.html][Understanding Multi-Head Latent Attention]] and [[https://github.com/ambisinister/mla-experiments][mla variants implementation]] I look into MLA because its presence in DeepSeek-V2 confused me and I needed to understand it better. In general working on this stuff has been really gratifying, I feel like I understand a lot about how the pieces slot together. Learned some [[https://www.manim.community/][Manim]] to make some of the figures in this post.
     - *Data work for SSBMRank Summer 2024* That time of year again, didn't do a ballot myself since I've been too busy to follow the game.
     - *Arch Linux Installation* My wife's thinkpad broke this month, which was a nice excuse to buy her a new one for her upcoming Bioinformatics degree. In the meanwhile, rather than tossing the broken thinkpad, I bought a replacement LCD (which was what had broken), did some surgery, and threw Arch Linux on it. I'm using XFCE4 and i3wm, and overall the learning curve for this has been much less bad than I had been led to believe it would be.
**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/media.html#org2263bd9][Soul Blazer]] pretty good
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/media.html#org2263bd9][Shadowrun]] pretty bad
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/media.html#orgc89c1e7][Mario Tennis: Power Tour]] what an incomprehensibly weird game.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Yp5SdFjC4][Flure [cover by TORWAI x BOMOSTIN]​]] hes cooking
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqkjrXS_AIg][Gourmet Race (PAL Version) {siivagunner}]] one of the best rips in a long time
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ybktnZ34og][Top US Recruit vs D1 Recruit]] I miss playing tennis
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd_BZfO1L24][Wii Play Billiards 9 break]] brute forcer pulled through, turns out this is possible!
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4izoWYFmNg0][GATECRASHER: An All-Women's Parkour Action Film]] really beautifully filmed, awesome video
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDQvE_lhRbg][Amputee Rock climber takes leg off during competition]] paraclimbing is so sick, love to see the creative problem solving
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBu319ww9SI][Mother-of-pearl chess]] I am a sucker for this sort of craftsmanship

*** June 2024
**** Things I Made
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/deepseek.html][Understanding Modern LLMs via DeepSeek]] worked really hard on this for some reason
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/wason.html][WILT: Wason Inductive Logic Test for LLMs]] this was cool, got to see a lot of the character of each of the models
**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://research.character.ai/optimizing-inference/][Optimizing AI Inference at Character.AI]] MQA, longformer attention for 5/6 layers, [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12981?ref=research.character.ai][sharing KV cache]] across multiple layers, inter-turn caching, int8 quantization. I have a negative opinion on how almost all of this interacts with performance but given that they are getting 20% of Google's request volume (???) I certainly see the value.
     - [[https://blog.alexalemi.com/kl-is-all-you-need.html][KL is all you need]] KL Divergence can be framed as how quickly you can tell apart P and Q if P were true. Most objectives in ML can be reframed as minimizing this, where P is the real world and Q is our world model. This post rederives a bunch of common objectives starting from graphical models of the task and KL divergence between P and Q, very neat. "Simply draw an accurate causal model of the world, then augment it with anything you wish and finally draw a second diagram in the same random variables that corresponds to your marker of success. Take the KL between the two and you've got yourself a reasonable objective."
     - [[https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook][Deep Learning Tuning Playbook]] start with stuff that works / hyperparams that are popular, have clear goals for experiments, use bayesian optimization tools after initial tests, optimize input pipeline, run eval at larger batch than training, save checkpoints often, etc. Lots of little tricks for bigger projects, worth revisiting. 
     - [[http://www.topology.org/tex/conc/mathlearn.html][How to learn mathematics - the asterisk method]] waste little time on things you already understand.
     - [[https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character][Claude's Character]] Claude 3 has a phase in RLHF where it uses synthetic data and self-ratings to move itself towards a prewritten "character" that has some set of values. Wonder if this could be reproduced in a small model, details are scarce here since it's not a paper.
     - [[https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/][The Many Ways that Digital Minds Can Know]] interesting thoughts on "integration vs coverage", analogies to search engines
     - [[https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/][Neural Networks, Manifolds, and Topology]] wish I knew more topology
     - [[https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/memory_efficient_attention/memory_efficient_attention.ipynb][Memory Efficient Attention: Attention does not need O(n^2) memory]] jax still confusing to me but straightforward that you can save memory by chunking the operation and combining everything.
     - [[https://x.com/jacob_pfau/status/1801747928601510022][gpt-4o understands ascii art but can't read it]]
     - [[https://x.com/alz_zyd_/status/1801707610158010842][Fashion Design High School student gets 12th at Alibaba Math Contest]] This seems insane
     - [[https://x.com/nl3v_/status/1789491474188403148][quant rules of thumb for param size]] keep losing this
     - [[https://x.com/airkatakana/status/1778732265436283217][RATTATA]] 
*** May 2024

**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUFWOR3cpRo][Hardcore Home Gyms - Strongman Archaeology with James Fuller]] wouldn't have thought of this as a discipline with a substantial technological history but I was very wrong about that
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhS_MyZTNVQ][Empty Space (Alpha Mix) {Siivagunner}]] The Siiva jokes about this were so good
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHTxtQAckAU][MLB's Slowest Pitcher Was Completely Unhittable]] shocked how interesting of a story this was, YouTube is such a funny and cruel game; the rest of this channel's videos having ~1000 views feels unfortunate light of how good this video is

**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://x.com/AlexIrpan/status/1771975818568462698][Solving Crew Battle Strategy With Math]] cool post, probably needs matchup adjustment for matchup intransitivity but interesting nontheless

**** Things I Made
     - [[https://x.com/Ambisinister_/status/1764011598967087431][EURank 2023]] did Data Processing for this
*** February 2024
**** Things I Consumed
     - Polaris Cube: Pretty interesting, thought it was going to be harder to solve given how difficult it was to turn and scramble, but I figured it out after about 15-20 minutes. 
     - Yuxin 8 Petals Cube: Easy to solve but enjoyed the process of figuring out the steps to do so. 
     - Meilong Clover 3x3: Just a 3x3 with no centers. Sharp points, not fun to turn, but the lack of centers is a cute added challenge
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/media.html#orgfb8e4c0][Suikoden II]] honestly, amazing. 
*** January 2024

** 2023
*** May 2023
**** Updates
     - *Started meditation* making an earnest attempt to really grind this. I’ve done this sort of haphazardly once or twice every few months but I’m really buckling down this time.
     - *Hit 150k ranking points in ITL* switching from ddr a20 grind to ITG tech was a great decision; this is so much more fun, by orders of magnitude.

**** Things I Made
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/Bracket_Stamina.pdf][Bracket Stamina]] finally did this after a long period of thinking about this idea. 
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/bluelock.html][Simulating the Blue Lock Second Selection]] a fun short post. I had a lot of curiosity about how this would resolve and I came to a surprisingly clear answer. I love this sort of overly convoluted plot nonsense, it makes engaging with media more fun. 

*** April 2023
**** Updates
     - *Got Married* one of the most important things of my entire life happened! 
     - *Built a PC* bought an amd graphics card by accident because I am stupid but at least I can play games now.
     - *Attended dreamhack San Diego* honestly this tournament was fun. Lots of criticisms about it but overall it was a fun vibe.

**** Things I Made
     - [[https://twitter.com/ambisinister_/status/1651419662796611584?s=46&t=QtZNzHJrwe6wrCmS66Evtg][We are playing in the same lag]] this was honestly kind of silly and I messed up the audio channels but I thought this would be funny and it was, should let myself be happy about it.

**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQcwNXfehzU][Para Climber does 8A/V11 on Kilterboard]] This is absolutely nuts
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_ClvO-FZE][SM64 Blinded 120 Star]] I can't even imagine being blindfolded for this long, let alone doing all of this crazy stuff.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKpkEjJQZ5E][This game makes you FUSE POKEMON]] honestly amazing how much effort this probably took from so many people -- inspiring stuff from the pokemon fangame scene.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjAj9Lc674][Falling | Serial Experiments Lain x Dua Lipa]] 

*** March 2023
**** Updates 
     - *Started regularly playing melee again* after a long break I have started practicing and playing matches. Went through a difficult derust but in spite of it I’ve been enjoying it.
     - *Bought an Ltek* needed a way to exercise in my LA residence, don’t have a car to drive around to get parts for a travel pad. But the bullet on this because I heard it’s good. 

**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjtGWckETpc][Why Carpet Tennis Courts were Permanently Banned]] honestly did not know this was ever a seriously played surface, that's really cool!
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3ZcVeWZ7L8][[DDR A]Healing Vision Angelic mix Legendary PFC]] cool enough to be considered semi freestyle imo, double stealth nobar and them doing the death run facing opposite directions is simply too swag

*** February 2023
**** Updates
     - *Moved to Los Angeles*
     - *Started working at Riot*
**** Things I Made
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/ssbmrank2022.html][Data notes on ssbmrank 2022]] I consider it a major milestone that standard deviations were released for the Melee top 100. A lot of slightly frustrating discussion was had about 2nd vs 3rd, but I’m mostly happy that we can talk about the spots as distributions rather than diracs.
**** Thing I Consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_iIVNV_AMA][The RBY Ubers Metagame]] I don't really play showdown but this video was a ton of fun
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzjngz7nug8][Plastic Love (Rick Astley AI Cover)]] man these models are powerful aren't they
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18BgsxEkAE0][One in a Trillion Three Knights Tango Checkmate]] the coolest puzzle I've ever seen, and I've done thousands of puzzles.

*** January 2023
**** Updates
     - *Left my Job* will have fond memories of APL
     - *Went to Genesis 9* let's go Jmook
     - *Bought an Anbernic 353m* I love this thing, it was a great purchase

**** Things I Made
     - [[https://t.co/04q7ILkbBa][SSBMRank 2022]] Maybe a bit much to put this in "Things I made" but I certainly did do a bunch of work for it as the data lead, a panelist, and a blurb writer. Check out my Gahtzu blurb in particular I'm proud of that one.

**** Things I Consumed
     - *Final Fantasy 6* played through the SNES version with the improved localization patch. Thought it was a great game, although following Chrono Trigger certainly exposed some of the frustrating things about it. Encounter rate was annoying, being underleveled in certain spots was annoying, and the whole World of Ruin started to feel like it was just padding the game's length. That said, it was still great: my opinion on Kefka as the game's main villain shifted a bit after the final fight, where it's clear he's just a big metaphor for death and that's why he's so psychotically, cartoonishly evil.
     - *Megaman Legends (PSX)* This game was fun, but like FF6 it made me appreciate other games more. Targeting / lock on / auto-aim mechanics were all absolutely horrific, and I constantly thought of how amazing Ocarina of Time was with it's z-target implementation. Before 3D games had established standards for movement there must have been a good deal of experimentation.
     - *Advance Wars* enjoyed this game, scratched the chess itch a bit for me
     - *Advance Wars 2* everybody said this game was so much better but it really felt like the same game as Advance Wars 1 but with a more annoying power mechanic. Overall good though.
     - [[https://youtu.be/zNI2lSoplXE][Stafford Gambit DESTROYS Kitten]] this is a truly delightful computer vs computer chess game
     - [[https://youtu.be/FhkLfz0GKYU][GDC - Q*Bert Retrospective]] the hubert story had me in tears
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwa0qbDx2dA][The tech that nearly ruined titanfall speedruns]] super dope video about creative community-driven solutions to emergent problems in high-level gameplay.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RosDxQIjf8][Moyun - Playing God Guzheng Cover]] wow this sounds amazing, wild how faithful this sounds to the original as a cover while being independently interesting.

** 2022
*** December 2022
**** Updates
     - *Got a job at Riot Games* super excited for this new chapter in my life! I’ll be starting at Riot in February as a senior data scientist
     - *Finally got COVID* I had been avoiding it for so long but I suppose the reaper comes for us all someday. Put a bit of a damper on my productivity but I did my best to work through it.
     - *Worked as Data Lead of the new SSBMRank 2022* it was cool getting tasked with this important role after so many years in the community, hope I do it justice.

**** Things I Made 
      - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/contradictions.html][Melee Rankings are a Game of Contradictions]] short post on metrics, and how different metrics can tell different stories about the same information. People on Twitter seemed to like it! 

**** Things I Consumed
     - *Chrono Trigger* finally got around to playing this after putting it off for so long, and wow, it did not disappoint! Genuinely quite impressed about how deserved all the hype is, and in particular how they managed to convey this story seemingly free from all the worst elements of JRPGs. The soundtrack was truly amazing, the character design was great, even some more subtle stuff like the overworld design was great.
     - [[https://youtu.be/SwH4er-YcyI][200 WPM with 2 Fingers (former WR)]] truly unbelievable
     - [[https://youtu.be/TPbroUDHG0s][Game Development in 8 Bits]] cool to think about the types of abstractions that were necessary under severe space constraints.
     - [[https://youtu.be/mopVLqSsv54][ADGQ - Chrono Trigger Glitchless by Puwexil]] I think I played through this game with the weakest combination of party members.

**** Resolutions

I say this every year, but maybe moreso than most years: what a whirlwind 2022 was for me. A lot of things took shape this year, and I made a lot of progress even if some things didn't go my way. 

Lots of highlights this year: breaking through and finding a new job, getting top 64 at Genesis 8, getting straight A's in my degree, [[https://github.com/ambisinister/LASTDANCE][improving]] a [[https://github.com/ambisinister/itsa17][lot]] at [[https://leetcode.com/ambisinister/][coding]]. I built a home gym and passed a few ITG 14s, but health stuff / surgeries kept me from really reaching my goals on that front. 

Probably my two biggest "regrets" about how 2022 went were that none of my papers got published and that I didn't spend enough time working on videos for Melee Stats. The former was certainly not from lack of effort: I've improved a lot at [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/lastdance.pdf][actually materializing ideas]] which could become papers, and I did actually submit a paper to Neurips (albeit to an unhappy result). Both of these are things I'm hoping I can address with a little bit more time in 2023.

Overall I think 2022 was very busy for me, and I'm hoping that I'll be able to be a bit more focused now that my health seems under control and I'm no longer job-searching. The goals are pretty clear:

- *Get married*
- *Continue progress at ML / do well at new job*
- *Return to making videos*
- *Get paper in conference*
- *Perform well in classes*
- *Get better at Melee*
- *Make friends in Los Angeles*
- *Make the coolest thing I've ever made*
- *Write and Code Cool Stuff all day*

No need to get too specific - with big lifestyle changes comes uncertainty, and I just need to keep doing what I'm doing.

*** November 2022
**** Updates
     - *Made a lot of things* I was pretty busy this month.
**** Things I made
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/lastdance.pdf][LASTDANCE: Layerwise Activation Similarity to Training Data for Assessing Non-Conforming Events (pre-preprint)]] A paper I wrote for school (the topic was "write a research paper" which I just ran with). A new form of anomaly detection to defeat a problematic case I have encountered before!
     - [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oO4wwpnzeOFcnGH93RlngINoF7bFDN9L?usp=sharing][Makemore Colab Notebook]] Went through Karpathy's makemore lectures and completed them in detail. Was some good practice with pytorch beyond simply chaining together torch.nn functions, and I got to learn some fun stuff about language modeling
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/parable.html][The Parable of the Monster]] a short attempt at fiction, which [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1597990075467718656][people seemed to like]]. Probably easy to understand [[https://twitter.com/SmashWorldTour/status/1597724859349483520][what this is trying to say]].
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn8rR823bGg][Melee Stats Discord Slander]] something lighthearted
**** Things I consumed
     - [[https://medium.com/@smashworldtour/smash-world-tour-official-statement-f568a3d135c8][Smash World Tour Cancelled]] Pretty terrible.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHpdYQEAADM][The Story of the Lowest Score in Tetris's Biggest Tournament]] very good, concise, interesting, well put together video.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENEpJJPQomg][I Turned The Fake Portable GameCube Into A Real Thing]] good times lurking in the benheck forums like fifteen years ago. Always love seeing this stuff.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO7yYzsBLyk][Polyphia Roasts Fan Covers]] "Roasts" certainly in the title for no reason but I enjoyed this video a lot
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niuCpSOX_jI][The Perfect Celeste Run - 202 berries max% no hit]] absolutely insane achievement
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA][3b1b - But what is a convolution?]] 3b1b has been kind of veering for me recently with primarily pop-math type stuff, but this feels like a good return to form for the channel in my opinion.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98EpPsaAF_k][TTC Stomp on the Thomp 0xA]] absolutely unreal that TTC, the most vertical level, is 0xA now. 

*** October 2022
**** Updates
     - *Went to The Big House 10* Didn't play well in bracket (out of practice) but I did enter [[https://challonge.com/smxbighouse2022][StepmaniaX]] and managed to not go 0-2 despite never playing the game before. It was fun!
     - *Was eligible for summit voting* This was [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1577384478023901184][quite funny]] to me! Obviously I didn't campaign, but it was fun to see my name there.
     - *Got surgery* this put me out of commission for most of October, but I did some fun stuff before then at least.
**** Things I made
     - [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/itsa17.html][Auto-Rating ITG Stamina Charts with Machine Learning]] using classical ML and Sequence-to-One models (RNN/LSTM) I rate ITG stamina charts and get a solid, decent result.
**** Things I consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0][Building Micrograd (Karpathy)]]
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo][Building Makemore (Karpathy)]] These are wonderful; Karpathy picks some great pedagogical examples which easily explain stuff which is usually waved off as "what you need to do" in most other types of instruction (e.g. "why do we use log probabilities?"). Recommend to anyone with interest in neural nets.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIGNyHHO8FI][CRUSHING GRANDMASTERS - Eric Rosen]] Watched a bunch of Rosen videos recovering from surgery. Chess is cool!
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDC6Q5upKPE][Why Cantonese Buddhists (traditionally) ate Oysters]] very interesting video! I would never have imagined Oysters as an acceptable vegetarian food. I suppose, the categories were made for man, and all that.
*** September 2022
**** Updates 
     - *Made a Machine Learning Twitter* can be found [[https://twitter.com/erykbanatt][here]], got tired of being nervous to post things related to what I do all day.
     - *Did tons of leetcode* I even got a [[https://leetcode.com/ambisinister/][fancy badge]] for not missing any of the daily challenges in september. This took up most of my free time this month.
**** Things I consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSJsviD_SU][Tesla AI Day 2022]] Some cool technology here; not a huge fan of the humanoid robot project in general, but stuff like "language of lanes" made this a worthwhile watch.

**** Reflections

Hard to maintain perspective on how this year went. I certainly worked
hard this year, but a lot of this hard work saw return in the form of
skill improvements, rather than obtained results. I'm hoping 2022 has
more in the way of impactful results compared to this year, but I
can't let myself get too down on myself about this; I am much better
at many important things even if my project-oriented brain does not
suggest this is the case.

Some highlights from this year:
	- Made the switch to Davinci Resolve, [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1350289342758084609][made some]] [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1403193523483119617][silly stuff]] as
          well as some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8imMRbi2qc][less silly stuff]].
	- Enrolled in a masters degree program, navigated the first semester successfully.
	- Improved a lot at melee, beat some good players, wrote some [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/lesson_notes.html][stuff about learning]].
	- Improved substantially at programming
	- Spent a lot of time playing dance games, moved from ITG 9s to ITG 13s.

More than previous years, a lot of 2021 for me was characterized by uncompleted projects. Not sure if this is a consequence of raised standards for projects or just working on a bunch of dead ends, but I feel disappointed with my "hit" rate, so to speak. I think a large part of why I felt I made so much progress in spots where I don't have much to show for is likely for this reason: lots of hard work on dead projects.

As much as one /could/ plan for 2021, my goals for last year are below, along with some judgements

- *Improve at Video Production* definite pass, large improvement is fairly undeniable
- *Complete 8 projects for the channel* did not pass; worked on a ton
  of projects and videos which ended up not meeting my standards for
  publication. Feel fairly good about stuff which we did publish, but
  otherwise disappointed in this.
- *Complete something feature length* failed
- *Complete something interview based* failed, although giving myself
  some leniency given that covid did not vanish in 2021
- *Spend more time implementing ideas, improving at SWE* definite
  pass, improved a lot at this in 2021
- *Complete at least three longform posts on the website involving ML* failed
- *Publish a paper* failed
- *Develop clear gameplans in all relevant matchups* I think I did
  this at least to some extent; my play improved a lot in 2021 for
  non-punish-game reasons
- *Have one strong performance in large tournament* There wasn't
  really anything large to attend but I did play fairly well a couple
  times in smaller netplay events.
- *Be more consistent about updating links page* neutral, could definitely have been better
- *Read 10 books, 2 textbooks* semi-failed, read 2 textbooks (for my
  degree) and did a lot of reading but not really books
- *Be more consistent about using anki* failed, this needs a lot of reevaluation

With this in mind I think my 2022 goals are fairly clear at the moment.

*Melee* 

- Produce and write videos which bring a collective 600k views to our channel in the next year.
- I would like to reach 50k subscribers but realistically I'm not sure how controllable that is.

*Learning*

- Take high performance in masters degree extremely importantly; perform well in all your classes.
- Reevaluate anki usage, do whatever is necessary to re-establish this as an important habit
- Code more, broaden skillset in a more impactful direction
- Figure out a way to track time in a way which is useful for estimating worktime
- Figure out a more streamlined note-taking system

*Writing*

- Publish /something/ written on this website at least once per month. It doesn't need to be a large post, it could just be some small notes explaining something which has been explained elsewhere. I just want to do more writing in a more consistent fashion.
- Publish a paper

*Misc*
- Pass an ITG 16.
- Build a home gym


*** November 2021

     - *Went to an arcade and played Pump it Up* forgot how much fun dance games are

**** Goals for August
     - *Build a Dance Pad and Get Good at DDR* I'd like to pass a 9 footer no bar at the very least
     - *For reps: Bench 135, Squat BW, Dumbbell OHP with 50s, figure out when you can deadlift* gym is one of those "don't make noise" gyms so maybe I'll deadlift at the climbing gym. Otherwise, these are well under my PRs but I haven't been lifting because of COVID
     - *Run three miles in half an hour* Running c25k for the fifth time seems a little overkill but even w1d1 for me is 2.1 miles in 30 minutes so surely this should be achieveable right
     - *Make Melee content with my name on it* Been doing a lot of melee content work but it's mostly been commission-style stuff

     - *Played through Majora's Mask* Of the Zeldas I've played this was a weird one because it had close to the best worldbuilding but the absolute worst gameplay. Feels really overrated but maybe that's just because the people who like it are so infatuated by the story.

**** Things I Made
     - [[https://twitter.com/MeleeStatsPod/status/1400213550501699590][Defeat Marth or Die]] made a 1 minute melee stats video to see if we could capitalize on the youtube algo's new preference for short videos. It didn't work, but the video was kind of fun.
     - [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1403193523483119617][POV: You whiffed a move vs falcon full stage away]] this was actually a fair bit of video editing for something so stupid but it was very popular on twitter at least.

     - *Got the second shot* hooray
     - *Played through Breath of the Wild* willing to admit I was not willing to give this game a fair shot after the slow beginning; it was quite good despite some larger flaws. Definitely a strong rec from me.

*** March 2021

**** Updates
     - *Learned to play Go* My fiancee and I binged [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/135/Hikaru_no_Go][Hikaru no Go]] this month and it prompted us to dig out that Go board I got for christmas eight years ago which has been in the closet ever since. It's got a very appealing level of abstraction for something with such simple rules, and it's giving me feelings like when I was grinding chess a lot many years ago.
     - *Reached 2400 puzzle rating on lichess* not that puzzle rating means anything, but a lot of people in the discords I am in started sharing puzzles they were doing and I needed to prove to myself that I could still hang with all the new chess zoomers.
     - *Had a few good tournaments* I've been juggling a lot of things but I managed to enter a few tournaments and have some solid showings, including a set from [[https://smash.gg/tournament/training-mode-tournaments-17/event/melee-ladder-east-coast/entrant/6935201][Ben]] who has been putting up good results recently. 

**** Goals for April
     - *Get the second shot of the vaccine*
     - *Improve at Go*
     - *Just Write* My hands have been hurting so will probably take a break from melee soon

**** Things I Made
     - *[[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/lesson_notes.html][Melee Lesson Resources for Fox Players + Thoughts on Learning in Melee]]* writeup on my perspective on the lessons offered by three coaches commonly used by Fox players, along with some of my personal thoughts on teaching/learning. Was surprised this got so much attention, but people seemed to like my thoughts on it! Always nice when that happens.

**** Reflections

2020 was nothing if not unusual; perhaps the most simultaneously eventful and uneventful year in human history. I spent the bulk of 2020 locked inside my apartment with my (now) fiancee, and as such I got better and worse at things as you might expect given that almost all of my time was spent in this small, dusty room. 

Productivity-wise, I have got to say that 2020 was not my best showing. Aside from my many strength and conditioning goals which were obviously not met due to closed gyms, I was a lot less academically productive than I would have liked also (very clearly also failing to meet my reading goals for 2020). 

But, well, 2020 is weird, and out of this relative lack of productivity came the pretty astonishing success of the Melee Stats youtube channel. I think by now the channel has accumulated something like 500,000 views since may, which is a degree of success I am honestly not very used to when it comes to Melee content. It's hard for me to gauge how happy or sad I should be about the dramatic increase in exposure I have helped bring to my work and the work of my friends, relative to the lack of success I've had in other areas. It's hard to think about, so I think I probably just won't think about it, and instead just think about what I could be doing better. 

For a more direct postmortem on the year, I think the clear winners for 2020 are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_7DcXwBlk][Plup vs Prince Abu - The Weirdest Set Ever Played]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8llYT7KGdI][Michael vs Bananas - The Only Reason We Play Melee]], which were two videos which were wildly more successful than I anticipated. I did a great deal of writing in 2020, and feel like I improved a lot at it, even if the longform pieces on this website were mostly limited to  [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ensembles.html][Invasion of the Ballot Snatchers (and Other Stories)]], [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/content_thoughts.html][On What Makes Content Good]], and the energy drink tier list. 

Moving forwards in 2021, I think I would like it a lot if I could just be more consistent about things. I think 2020 has largely been characterized for me by bursts of immense motivation for a single project, followed by periods where I feel like I am spinning my wheels until something happens and my motivation returns to me. Approaching things a little bit at a time may not even really dramatically affect my output, but it would allow me to have a clearer vision of the things I want to accomplish and how I plan on accomplishing them. 

My goals for 2020 I think are stratified across a few categories:

*Melee Stats*
- Improve at Video Production (broad goal)
- Complete 8 Projects for the Channel
- Complete something feature length (or maybe slightly shorter)
- Complete something interview-based

*Machine Learning*
- Spend more time actually implementing new ideas, improve at SWE (broad goal)
- Complete at least three longform posts on this website which involve a machine learning component
- Publish a paper

*Melee*
- Develop clear gameplans in all the relevant matchups
- Have one strong performance in a large tournament in 2021

*General Learning*
- Be more consistent about updating the links page, which has monthly goals on it
- Read 10 books, at least 2 of which are textbooks
- Be more consistent about using anki, miss fewer than half of days 

There are a number of other goals I have which are dependent upon the covid vaccine. These exist (i.e. health related, lifting goals) but I will hold my tongue on them until the return to society is a bit more set in stone. 

Regardless, definitely a weird year but onwards to 2021

*** September 2020
**** Updates
     - *Have been unusually busy* I've been unusually behind on pretty much everything, and the COVID-19 lockdown in the United States has taken a bit of a toll on my motivation. Regardless, I've been making (somewhat) steady progress on things anyways, and have managed to not entirely turn into jello (so far). 
**** Goals for October
     - *Go back to exercising regularly* been a bit on the backburner recently
     - *Learn something which allows for better artistic expression* probably drawing or more writing
     - *Draft skeleton of next video, purchase a video camera* Want to take a break from video stuff for a little bit but the ideas for what I'm gonna do next are unfortunately already forming
**** Things I Made
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8llYT7KGdI][Michael vs Bananas - The Only Reason We Play Melee]] I might be more proud of this work than I have on almost any single project I've ever worked on. It was truly exhausting working on this and I couldn't have done it without Wheat.
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DfglYtD6-218][Watching Paint Dry Has Never Been So Exciting! {Trailer}]] this joke was worth the $3.50 I paid for cheap watercolor paints
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/content_thoughts.html][On What Makes Content Good]] some thoughts on the "dynamic ceiling" which I've had kicking around for a while
**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IihBn_3LYXk][The Debacle of Blue Clay: Used Once and Never Again]] shocked this video isn't more popular, it's interesting, concise, and well-produced.

     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxFRjsVM-9g][Hanky Panky - The Greatest Player Nobody Knows]] a Melee Stats film spearheaded by Anokh Palakurthi, who you might remember as the author of The Book of Melee. I have editor / narration credits on this one, which is why the title of this month's entry is a bit different, but this was a fun project that I was glad a lot of people seemed to like.

     - *Attended [[https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2020/][CogSci 2020]]* Really wish this conference was not virtual, since I think I would have loved the opportunity to speak to some of these researchers in person, but alas. I'll see if I can post some notes about it somewhere later. 
**** Things I was a part of making
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgrAVAotDHk]["Lud Pay My Rent" - Ft. PGH Carroll & The Creative Melee Discord. Edit By Battery.]] This won Ludwig's combo video contest and as a result we got a bunch of money which most of us donated to charity. (I asked for my share to be donated to [[https://www.rainn.org/][RAINN]]). Definitely a pretty stacked roster so I felt pretty honored to be a part of it.
     - *Patreon-Exclusive: Directors' Commentary: Plup vs Prince Abu* Won't be including all of these but I figure it wouldn't hurt to include that we recorded this during this month, and that we plan on recording patron-exclusive behind-the-scenes content for our content moving forwards.

*** June 2020
**** Updates
     - *Got back into running*
     - *Worked on some stuff on and off*
     - *Mostly took it easy*
**** Goals for July
     - *Improve at Running* I mapped out a very hilly 5k route near my apartment, would be nice if I could get back into it and get some beginner milestones like 35:00 5k / 8:00 mile / whatever.
     - *Learn to Play Melee again*
     - *Finish projects* a few in the works, some I'm the lead on some I'm just collaborating with
**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DerbZV8u6-hA][The Future of Melee is Here - Rollback Netcode]] was in the closed beta for this; it's really amazing and makes the game playable again which is very nice considering we are all in a pandemic and unable to play irl 
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXzgS1aDb7TQ][SmashScope Guide]] super cool

*** May 2020
**** Updates
     - *Held 4 second handstand* I injured my leg halfway through this month so I was unfortunately unable to practice for much of the second half of the month, but [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1260645060871286784][here]] is a video of me doing a handstand (which isn't quite my longest but is pretty close)
     - *Super burned out* definitely pushed a bit too hard this month in general
**** Goals for June
     - *Purchase XLR Microphone* Given the success of our video this feels like a worthy purchase.
     - *Take some time off* I am very burnt out and need to spend a few days not working. I feel like I've earned this.
**** Things I Made
     - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_7DcXwBlk][Plup vs Prince Abu - The Weirdest Set Ever Played]] I worked for most of the month on this video and somehow more then [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1267873774239694850][one hundred thousand people]] watched it. I will be honest, I didn't expect so much attention on this project, and random internet people sure are capable of saying some mean things. I perhaps overdid my homage to Jon Bois in making this video, but I'm proud of the effort we put into it and I'm very happy so many people watched it. More to come.
**** Things I Consumed
     - [[https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/public/SDM_How_to_do_Research_Keogh.pdf][How to do good research, get it published]] good problems are important, have available data, and have clear win conditions. Domain experts from random fields can be good collab / problem-generation sources. Make sure your problem statement is super crystal clear /and/ falsifiable. Synthetic data is garbage for many reasons, but ultimately because data people care about is very important. Simplicity is strength for a researcher, a paper implicitly says "this is the easiest way to get results this good". Look to other fields for solutions! (see: Range). Discussions on Durer's rhino / refuting literature. Make sure your problem actually exists. The first page of a paper and the Anchoring effect. Reproducibility is important. Define Acronyms Before They Are Used. Use all the space.
     - [[https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules][Effective Learning: Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge]] Don't learn if you don't understand. Learn before you memorize. Build upon basics. Make cards as simple as possible. Cloze deletions are good (core of incremental reading). Use pictures. Use mnemonics (but only really with like 1-5% of your cards). Graphic deletion is good. Avoid sets or enumerations of items (atomize). Minimize interference. Optimize wording. Refer to other memories. Personalize / use examples. Rely on emotional states. context clues to simplify wording. Redundancy isn't so bad. Provide sources. Provide date stamping. Prioritize.
     - [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02779.pdf][Exploring the Landscape of Spatial Robustness]] I think this paper is cool since it's an "attack" which doesn't actually require a bad actor to see in operational use -- you could just tilt the camera wrong. Pretty wild that this happens even when you use data augmentation specifically to try to make it invariant to these changes. 
*** April 2020
**** Updates
     - *Reached 20 chinups, 60 seconds [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoUwmIe-KhMc][frogstand]], and stable headstand* pretty awesome month for me, training-wise.
     - *Paper which plagiarized my work was removed from the internet* what an great event! I honestly expected nothing to happen but I'm glad this was clear enough to others for me to feel some validation that I wasn't crazy for feeling miffed about not getting cited on something so derivative.
**** Goals for May
     - *Complete some novel video content* I am working with some friends on something I think will be really cool, and it's a nice change of pace to get to do some video editing / writing practice instead of focusing so much on empirical-type work
     - *Freestanding Handstand for ~5 seconds* I've been practicing wall handstands and I definitely think I have the strength for it, just a matter of finding the balance point and being brave.
     - *Make at least 500 anki cards* I've felt an unusual surge of motivation lately and it's being reflected in my reading and study habits. It's honestly not the worst thing if this doesn't continue as-is but as it stands I would like to make good use of this fleeting feeling.

**** Things I've Consumed
     - [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07780][Shortcut Learning in Deep Neural Networks]] a truly great paper; and I'm not just saying that because of the cogsci-AI intersection. Think the problems raised in this paper are really important and they really pick the correct papers to cover. Likewise, the references section being annotated is something I didn't realize I needed more of. A fantastic starting place for people interested in how models learn.
     - [[http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html][Augmenting Long-Term Memory (Neilsen, Anki)]] Using anki for reading papers: quick pass through -> add extremely elementary questions (which types of neural networks did alphago use?), do 5-6 of these passes and then do a thorough read. "I find Anki works much better when used in service to some personal creative project." Shallow reads of papers: 10-60 minutes, 5-20 anki cards. "Visualize the figure from X where Y". Break questions into atomic subcomponents, even if that means two cards on the same thing (ln -s filename linkname -> ln-s and filename linkname)
     - [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062901/pdf/nihms268518.pdf][The Misunderstood limits of folk science: an illusion of explanatory depth]] ask yourself to explain how things work before you decide you know how they work, especially for devices, where people often are overconfident they understand the relevant mechanisms just because the device itself is very easy to picture.

*** March 2020
**** Updates
     - *Purchased a stationary bike* I read some papers on low impact cardio and how it affects cognition, since I'm now mostly trapped inside and need to get creative about staying active. I settled on buying a stationary bike over other types of exercise equipment since a stationary bike would mostly allow for multitasking (flashcards, watching something, etc).
     - *Purchased a pair of gymnastics rings* Helpful for strength training and generally pretty cool training tool
     - *Set rep PR for pullups* not quite at 20 yet but close
**** Goals for April
     - *Become comfortable doing calisthenics* Since the gyms are all closed, I have been doing bodyweight training in order to stay in shape. Since calisthenics has a much higher skill component compared to powerlifting (since you add resistance by doing harder movements), I am currently a bit behind on the learning curve. A good measurable goal for this would be a 60 seconds frogstand.
     - *Continue doing high volume of pullups* I might have to get off of armstrong since the thursday and monday volumes usually leave me way too fatigued the next day and I feel like I would get tendonitis on this program eventually, but continuing a high volume of pullups in pursuit of the 20 rep set remains a goal of mine before progressing towards OAC variations.
     - *Cardio during multitasks* I have this stationary bike and I have a few references suggesting doing this during other tasks won't dramatically harm them, so it seems like a good use of time.
     - *Study hard, don't lose focus during quarantine*

     - *Stay inside during Coronavirus*
     - *Rerun armstrong program, aiming for 20 pullups*
     - *Try to maintain health / fitness / sanity during lockdown*
**** Things I've Consumed
     - [[https://www.deepmind.com/blog/article/Dopamine-and-temporal-difference-learning-A-fruitful-relationship-between-neuroscience-and-AI][Dopamine and Temporal Difference Learning: A Fruitful Relationship Between Neuroscience and AI]] dopamine neurons in rat brains have long been known to perform some sort of reward prediction analogous to TD learning in reinforcement learning; Deepmind + Harvard looked at many of these neurons to see if all of them together capture the full reward distribution instead of just the average. Turns out, they sorta do! Certain of these cells are more optimistic or pessimistic, and together from the ensemble you can reconstruct a pretty good representation of the ground truth reward distribution. Interesting to think of the implications of overweighing optimistic vs pessimistic dopamine cells.
     - [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0371-x.pdf][Working memory revived in older adults by synchronizing rhythmic brain circuits]] and this [[https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/files/bic/cross_frequency_coupling_soheilasamiee.pdf][powerpoint on cross frequency coupling]] the neuro in this paper is a bit out of this element (hence the unrelated powerpoint) but I think the implication that cognitive decline might be directly associated with phase amplitude decoupling is really interesting, since I've only ever really heard of PAC as a generic marker for brain activity. The fact that this can be recoupled in a non-invasive way to relatively lasting effects is kind of nuts.
     - [[https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/14/859][How does exercise treatment compare with antihypertensive medications?]] Meta-analysis suggests exercise is pretty comparable to drug intervention on this front, although the broad categories of "exercise" or even stuff like "resistance training" is highly variable depending on the subject. That said, the comparison is tricky because most people who exercise in these studies have pretty decent blood pressure at baseline, and restricting to only patients who would be labeled as hypertensive seems to suggest a greater chance for improvement there.
     - [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10246v2.pdf][LEARNING THE HELIX TOPOLOGY OF MUSICAL PITCH]] pitch can be modeled by a helix which makes a full turn every octave, some experiments to learn a 3d representation of 1d data to produce this structure.
     - [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01827v1.pdf][Analyzing the Dependency of ConvNets on Spatial Information]] randomly shuffling features or channels in the later layers of convnets largely doesn't affect performance (assuming it's done in train time as well); spatial information in later layers is mostly useless, which is pretty interesting.
     - [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08653.pdf][Fooling automated surveillance cameras: adversarial patches to attack person detection]] I think it's very interesting that you can just print these out and wear them if you train the adversarial network to output a particularly friendly image for printing. However, I think that /concerns/ about this sort of attack are somewhat overblown (and are mostly demonstrations on how brittle deep networks are) since I think there are more likely causes for misclassification than adversarial attacks which often rely on access to the model to generate patches anyways (e.g. stop signs which are defaced or at unusual angles, people of poorly represented ethnicities in the training data, etc)
     - [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04599v1.pdf][Fundamental Tradeoffs between Invariance and Sensitivity to Adversarial Perturbations]] Making a network better against sensitivity-based adversarial examples makes it actively worse against invariance-based adversarial attacks, which is a pretty interesting followup to the [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00401.pdf][ICLR 2019]] paper describing their existence.
     - [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219300983?via%253Dihub][Ad libitum Weekend Recovery Sleep Fails to Prevent Metabolic Dysregulation during a Repeating Pattern of Insufficient Sleep and Weekend Recovery Sleep]] I know there's lots of papers telling you not to do the weekday sleep deprivation -> weekend crash thing, but seeing that doing this reduces insulin sensitivity alongside damaging eating habits / circadian rhythm / etc was pretty jarring.
     - [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1719694?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents][Curiosity and Exploration]] "We also have evidence that prolonged subjection to an inordinately monotonous or unstimulating environment is detrimental to a variety of psychological functions"... "organisms may seek out stimulation that taxes the nervous system to the right extent, when naturally occurring stimuli are either too easy or too difficult to assimilate." Discomfort from a lack of information and /specific/ exploratory responses to alleviate it is called /curiosity/, compared to simple novelty- or variety-seeking behavior via /diversive/ exploration. By experiment, older children like looking at more complicated patterns than younger children. Nearness to equiprobability -> greater curiosity. Patterns which emerge which elicit specific exploration are usually referred to as "interesting" whereas ones which emerge from diversive exploration are considered "pleasing". Experiments involved providing methamphetamine to rats which is some true 1960s science.

*** January 2020
**** Updates
     - *Met monthly goals* Not much to say about them, feels nice though
     - *Got Plagiarized* Kind of wild that this happened before I got a proper citation, but I have always wanted to know what the consequences for something like this are, so it'll be funny to see how that ends up going.
**** Goals for February
     - *Do some more cardio* I've been fairly interested in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D_g05NZ3rro8][jump roping]] recently, and I think it would be good to incorporate some more endurance work into my exercise just for general health benefits.
     - *Make reading more consistent* I think in the coming month my life will probably undergo some big changes so I will need to reorganize my daily routines in order to make my learning more effective.
     - *Spend less time on social media* As always, after mpgr season spending time on social media irritates me far more than is useful for motivating me to do projects. Spending some time unplugged should make me happier and allow me a more focused headspace.
**** Things I've Made
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ensembles.html][Invasion of the Ballot Snatchers (and Other Stories) - Decorrelated Errors in Panel-Based Rank Voting]] I ran some simulations to illustrate the theoretical justification for panel based voting in MPGR.

The authors claim that human "start-up software" make human performance benchmarks nebulous, and identify a number of conceptual elements which could be targeted to make AI think and learn more like humans: intuitive physics and psychology, compositionality, learning-to-learn, and fast/efficient real-time learning and thinking. Main article claims constraints based on biological plausibility are putting the cart before the horse, since our understanding of these biological systems are, themselves, cartoon representations of their actual functionality, and subject to change as we gain more understanding of them. Peer commentary was a refreshing component of this, and was categorized by the authors into three axes: nature vs nurture, symbolic vs sub-symbolic, and coherent theories vs theory fragments. Some of the more common specific components on this front were concerns of embodiment, social cognition (i.e. learning from other agents, or a culture), and intrinsic motivation. Definitely a very good read, and led me to a number of other cool papers.

**** Reflections

I don't think it would surprise anybody to hear that I consider 2019 to be, probably, my most successful year ever. The most exciting thing to me about this year was that it blew the door open for my personal development, and I can see so much space in front of me to continue to grow. At the end of last year, my number one goal was /Dramatically restructure my life to spend higher percentage of time doing things I find interesting instead of just a few hours a day/, and at the risk of sounding too much like I'm bragging, I think I can safely say that I crushed this goal. I finally feel like I'm doing something I'm well-suited for, and while stuff like motivation waxes and wanes, the amount of time I actually get to dedicate towards genuinely fascinating things is so much higher than it has ever been. I don't feel reliant on feeling especially motivated to do things, which may have somewhat harmed my motivation levels but vastly improved my output. 

That said, an extremely large share of this output is now taking place outside this website, which detracted somewhat from the second goal I had this year (i.e. 15 projects, 4-5 being big ones with longform writing piece attached). I was able to put out [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/personainsmash.html][Predicting Personality with Playstyle in Super Smash Brothers]] which even now I'm shocked I was able to complete in such a short timeframe (8 days). However, 2019 was largely characterized by a sort of academic [[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Power_leveling][powerleveling]] in my life, with comparatively little interesting output (at least public-facing). I feel good about my progress (getting spun up on deep learning from the ground up, working through probmods, reading literally hundreds of papers) but now that I'm more settled into my new lifestyle I'm hoping that I can put a greater focus on making cool things. 

I was unable to read 20 books, but given that so much of my time was spent reading I am just going to count this as a successful goal anyways (going through probmods alone involved reading close to 60 papers alongside the textbook, with exercises, and only incremented this counter by 1). 

I feel good about my fitness progress in 2019, as well, although perhaps not relative to the amount of time I put into them this year. I went from ~V2+/V3- to ~V3+/V4- at climbing, which was not quite as much progress as I would've liked but was good progress nonetheless. My weight training was up and down, largely influenced by my dramatic lifestyle changes this year, but the important thing is that I'm back on the grind and I'm stronger than I've ever been. I'm definitely not there yet, but I made some progress and I'm happy with that. 

2020 goals:
- *1/2/3/4 plate compound lifts* This should put me just past intermediate for most lifts, unless my weight dramatically changes
- *Climb V6* Figure this will be a nice counterbalance to ensure my weight doesn't get out of control
- *Get published* 
- *Read at least 4 textbooks, across at least 2 fields*
- *Read 15 books*
- *Post at least 5 longform writing pieces on this website*
- *Fully optimize lifestyle around happiness* 

*** November 2019
**** Updates
- *Completed Armstrong Program* I did this program for 6 weeks and brought my max chin-up from 8 to 16 reps and my total volume per week from 150ish reps to 300ish reps. My form still needs some work and it’s a bit of a ways from my original goal of 20 reps, but given that I gained a little bit of weight I am fairly pleased with how this turned out and plan to maintain the habit of doing pull-ups so I can get to my goal of 20
- *Started lifting weights again* honestly fairly irritated that I pulled myself away from weights this long, considering how nice it feels to do these workouts. I’ve managed to get most of the way back to where I was at my strongest, which I think says an embarrassing amount about how low those lifts were, but the important thing is that I am making steady progress.
**** Goals for December
- *Enjoy my holidays, reflect upon 2019* December is nice because it’s a nice season of burnout prevention along with a good arbitrary stopping point for annual postmortem. I’ll spend some of December drilling into what exactly I have learned, what I want to learn, and how I can improve in my learning process.
- *Set PRs on all main lifts* this should be fairly doable since I think I’m roughly 10-20 pounds away from my best ever lifts (although I am a bit heavier than I was back then, so not by wilks). I should probably record videos of these to check my form, but I doubt I’ll post them anywhere public.
**** Things I’ve made
- [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1198423142621954049][SSBM hitbox styleGAN]] a fun little project I decided to abandon a full writeup for, considering the results were not as nice as I would’ve wanted for that. 
**** Things I’ve consumed
- [[https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speaker_adaptation/][Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-to-Speech Synthesis]] and unofficial [[https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning][recreation]]. I'm thinking about playing around a bit with speech synthesis and this seems like a very fun paper to start with.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DghuaqD8rHvY][Get the most out of your Standing Pike]] amazingly well presented, clear, concise. Encouraging! 
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/cq3en0/part_iii_a_physicist_completes_a_linear_algebra/][A Physicist Completes a Linear Algebra Result]] a legendary story. "A colleague of mine of straddles physics and math said, 'he's famously like a cheery firehose of mathematics, guess he's power-washing you today.' I felt clean."


*** October 2019
**** Updates
     - *Did a lot of reading, unfortunately distributed* lots of pages read, not many completed books.
     - *Went to my friend's wedding* it was great
**** Goals for November
     - *Finish things started in October* I made some progress on a few things (books, projects, etc) so I would like to complete those this month.
     - *Get Stronger, Do 20 Pull-Ups* I have recently started the [[http://armstrongpullupprogram.com/][Armstrong Pull-Up Program]] since I wanted to work on my pulling strength relative to my bodyweight, and currently max out at about 11 for a single set (at roughly 165 lbs); likewise some friends of mine are going to be starting [[https://saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/][GCZLP]] soon and I feel this is a good as excuse as ever to get myself back in the weight room (and seems like a nice transition from GSLP).
     - *Get more disciplined with study habits* I've fallen behind on Anki repetitions and my note-taking has been lagging behind what it normally is, so fixing those should be a priority for me this month.
**** Things I've Consumed
***** Books
       - [[https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml][Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow]] The second edition of this book, updated for tensorflow 2. Generally pretty good! More detail than documentation, but not bogged down with theory and more focused on the actual practice + reasoning behind things, which is what I was hoping for. Full thoughts [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3027172298?book_show_action%3Dfalse][here]].
***** Others
      - [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_8__N1zutE8QTE0VXJmNGxSLVU/view][The Brand New Climber's Training Primer]] Generally a big fan of this periodization idea which is talked about, and I'll need to do some thinking about it. The general splitting of Base/Strength/Power/Power-Endurance/Stamina seems like a nice way to formalize my current issue of having wildly different fitness focuses at any given time, and cycling through them seems relatively sensible.
      - [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTV7-FpkN-Su_LDgfy5LIl0DZOjv1AQM/view][The Vertical Jump Bible 2.0]] building off the idea of periodization, wanted to do some research into generic lower body power routines since most of the climbing literature talks primarily about upper body power. My big takeaways here are that for a good vertical jump there are three general locuses of training: one - getting to 1.5x bodyweight barbell squat and low bodyfat percentage; two - if your standing vertical is less than your depth jump, you should work on power; three - if your depth jump is better than your standing vertical, you should work on strength. There's lots of routines in this book I might revisit when I work on power but the two takeaways for me are that I should probably add power cleans and depth jumps / pylometrics to that part of my periodization (if I care about it)
      - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/wiki/starting_to_stretch][Starting to Stretch: /r/flexibility beginner routine]] I go back and forth about whether I consider myself particularly flexible but I think it would be useful if I worked on mobility a bit; I might add this to my pre-sleep routine at some point, mostly saving this here for when that time comes.

*** September 2019
**** Updates
     - *Did some traveling for work* spent some time in Chicago this month, which was [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1172612550489456641][an interesting experience]]. I tried some deep dish pizza and it was okay, definitely quite a bit less good compared to New Haven / New York / Most other good pizza I've eaten in my life.
     - *Research thoughts* this month I've been grappling with the fact that research involves trying to unearth things which are not known to have answers already, and therefore there are no promises about whether your idea will actually work or not. I think this is a really important part of the process, even though it feels not-so-nice when your beautiful idea doesn't pan out. Confronting your failures in this way, I think, is a very important part of being a researcher, and I'm learning that it's important to view the chance to explore an idea as a fun thing for its own sake, independent of the idea solving your problem outright.
**** Goals for October
     - *Read Books* My book reading progress has stalled substantially in the last few months, despite my daily reading increasing substantially. I think October will be really good for working through my backlog of books, which I've generally been neglecting in favor of papers / documentation / etc. 
     - *Make Things* It's been a while since I did anything cool outside of work, so let's aim to change that this month
**** Things I've Made
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/resume.pdf][Updated resume]] using awesomeCV as a template. Nothing special, really, just wanted practice using LaTeX and wanted to update my resume to my current job.

      - [[http://users.metu.edu.tr/serge/courses/111-2011/textbook-math111.pdf][How To Prove It (Velleman)]] mostly review, and still working through the exercises. Clear writing and generally a good book. Full thoughts [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3001976128?book_show_action%3Dfalse&from_review_page%3D1][here]].
***** Papers
      - [[http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/faculty/activity/_fulltext/schwartz-michael-2003-2003michiganstatedcllawreview447.pdf][Teaching Law Students to be Self-Regulated Learners]] Mirrors some of my frustrations, both with the attitude of teachers and the attitude of learners towards teachers, which I consider to be extremely poor particularly in the United States. "When given appropriate instruction, nearly all law students can achieve mastery -- not minimum competence, but mastery -- of the skills of the novice lawyer." Setting goals and monitoring self-efficacy can *boost achievement by 30 percent* and, critically, this is not an innate thing, you can teach it and learn it and just reap this 30% boost. Self-Regulated / Expert learning involves three phases which abstractly can be thought of as the scientific method applied to academic tasks -- /forethought, performance, and reflection/, a large portion of which is oriented towards calibrating awareness of not knowing something, and being able to comprehend how you would turn yourself into someone who /does/ know that thing. Teaching students to approach their own learning in this fashion generally makes things happier and easier for everyobdy involved, since the students will be able to assess where/why they don't understand something and prevent the teacher from having to dig around to find this out. Really interesting to see where this entirely practical perspective intersects with the psychology literature on this topic. "[Those with] mastery goals are more likely to ask themselves how they can accomplish their goals and what they will learn (and usually select tasks based on the learning value of those tasks) whereas those with performance goals are more likely to ask whether they can do the task and whether they will look smart (and usually select tasks based on their ease)." . 
***** Games
      - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqyOapJgLcEI][Celeste - Chapter 9: Farewell]] So much to say, so little space to say it. Chapter 9 is an amazing culmination of all my favorite things about my favorite single-player video game, with a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D9TczL8fJi-0][soundtrack]] combining all the motifs together from the previous chapters. The level design is great, it expects so much from the player and in turn feels like you've actually achieved something meaningful every time you complete an obstacle. Obstacles designed to be passed using wavedashing is something I didn't expect to experience in canon, but the team behind Celeste goes above and beyond here, adding rooms [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DVZeBtF7bPAE][specifically designed for skilled play]]. I honestly could rant about Celeste for hours (which I have [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/celeste.html][have done before]]), but all I will say about farewell is that it's supposed to serve as a goodbye, but it instead completely reignited my interest in the game and I've been on a quest to collect all the goldens (currently at 191/202).
***** Videos
      - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DJ3FcbFqSoQY][Developing a Permanent Treatment for Lactose Intolerance Using Gene Therapy]] I recently discovered about myself that I am lactose intolerant, and somebody linked me this video after I made a [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1177364195567984641][tweet]] about it. This is, easily, one of the most psycho things I've ever seen. I have mixed feelings about the philosophy behind this video (that is: DIY biohacking should be open source. Feels noble for something so useful but also seems wildly dangerous, not informed enough to say myself), but I have to applaud this guy for dedicating his academic career to solving a problem about his own body /and actually doing it/. 
***** Music
      - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DuAg_NYH57J8][Celeste Piano Collections: Awake (Lena Raine, Trevor Alan Gomes)]] A really cool arrangement, gives me Chopin vibes.

*** August 2019
**** Updates
     - *Cycled off of Caffeine* I was drinking something like 280-300mg of caffeine per day and realized that I was losing focus on weekends because I wouldn't drink energy drinks and then get headaches. I quit cold for a week and it was miserable, but now caffeine does the normal things to me again. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyphylaxis][Techyphylaxis]] is crazy! Will need to keep an eye on this in the future.
     - *Was less productive* August, admittedly, vanished a bit from me. I worked hard at work and did a little it of reading, but I spent a good amount of this month doing stuff like watching anime and watching random youtube videos. I think this is okay! Having this sort of month I think is pretty good for helping you prevent burnout, and I think this was largely inevitable given that a good amount of this month was spent doing the above.
**** Goals for August
     - *Get more comfortable using LaTeX* I am starting to use latex a bit more often and I think spending some time grinding out notes using it would be useful.
     - *Math/Stats Grind* In particular, I want to continue working through my statistics textbook and Velleman's [[http://users.metu.edu.tr/serge/courses/111-2011/textbook-math111.pdf][How To Prove It]].
     - *Greater focus on reading* especially outside of work
**** Things I've Consumed
***** Statistics
      - [[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa63/cbf9b514a9bc4991a0ef48542b689e2fa08d.pdf][The Earth is Round (p < .05)]] Extremely angry article on how null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is terrible. "I resisted the temptation to call it statistical hypothesis inference testing". Introduces the illusion of attaining improbability. Criticizes the accept-reject dichotomy, since rejection of null hypothesis doesn't necessarily mean your theory about it is true. Setting the effect size to 0 as H_0 is literally always false for small enough effect sizes, see Meehl's "crud factor" (Everything is related to everything else). 
      - [[http://datacolada.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/3416-Sedlmeier-Gigerenzer-Psych-Bull-1989-Do-studies-of-statistical-power-have-an-effect-on-the-power-of-studies.pdf][Do Studies of Statistical Power Have an Effect on the Power of Studies? (Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer 1989)]] Nobody ever mentions statistical power alongside significance, with median power as low as .25 often being used as confirmation of the null hypothesis. Standard statistical practice (which I read about in /Introductory Statistics with R/ and apparently comes from Cohen 1965) fixes power at .80 and alpha at .05 before calculating n, but much research just tries to collect some /n/ first, and Cohen found that for medium effect sizes the median experiment had a 50% chance of finding a significant effect /in cases where there was a true effect/. 24 years later, in a meta review, it turns out nobody listened to Cohen, and power is still ignored. "Obviously the important thing... is to have a low real error, not to have a 'significant' result at a particular station. The latter seems to me to be nearly valueless in itself" -Gosset, 1908
***** Videos
      - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DOjlKIjLWq-Y][The Eight Spiders - Lemmino]] One of my favorite youtube videos ever, honestly, and one I think I will show to every researcher I ever encounter for the rest of my life. It is critically important for anybody who works with references to understand the pitfalls of circular reporting. The reveal that Lisa Brigit Holst is an anagram of "This is a big troll" blew me out of my seat.

*** July 2019
**** Updates
     - *There are a lot of things to read* I spent a lot of July reading interesting papers surrounded by people that know so many things. I am really happy with this, but it's hard to not get wrapped up in how much I feel I have left to learn. I'm trying to balance a pragmatic learning strategy with a broader intellectual curiosity, but we will see how that evolves as the months go by.
**** Goals for August
     - *Grind Out Stats* My stats background is very rudimentary at the moment, and I think I'd make huge strides in understanding a lot of the more technical work in my field.
     - *Do more programming* Most of my out-of-work time was spent reading in July, and as much as I love reading I think a bit more focus on practice rather than theory would make me feel more secure about my progress.
**** Things I've made
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/lagless.html][Delays Have Dangerous Ends: On Monitors in SSBM]] glad learning webPPL paid off so quickly! Turnaround time for writing this was one day across a session of something like 6 hours.
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/learnmap.html][Self-Directed Reading in Computational Cognitive Science]] big syllabus-like document containing the list of books and resources I hope to go through in the next year or two; will probably update frequently
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/probmods.html][Probmods Notebook]] Contains review, extra readings, and my solutions to most of the exercises.
**** Things I've consumed
***** Textbooks
      - [[https://probmods.org/][Probabilistic Models of Cognition]] Web textbook on the probabilistic approach to cognitive science, using probabilistic programming to model learning and reasoning. My full thoughts can be found in the notebook above, but I thought this was super cool! I wish there were more resources for cognitive scientists like this.

There's a number of things Turing came up with that were so impressively ahead of the curve, and yet a huge portion of this paper is dedicated to assuaging concerns that "God provided only man with souls" and "The statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming". Hilarious!
      - [[https://insights.ovid.com/psychological-bulletin/plbul/2012/11/000/reconstructing-constructivism/4/00006823][Reconstructing Constructivism: Causal Models, Bayesian Learning Mechanisms, and the Theory Theory (Gopnik & Wellman 2012)]] A great paper which I would tl;dr as "why should a cognitive scientist care about probabilistic modeling". I think this paper is written at an undergraduate level, and contains only one equation in it (that being bayes theorem). Probabilistic models and causal bayes nets as potential answers to the inverse problem, which allows you to /actually figure out/ the highest-probability explanation for a set of evidence (i.e. a set of symptoms for a list of diseases). Some evidence that children learn in a way roughly approximable by probabilistic models (I wish I remembered more from my undergrad developmental psych class!). /Bayesian Pedagogical Models/ formalize a thought I remember having in an intro psychology course - children assume different probabilistic models if they assume the person they are interacting with are trying to teach them something (i.e. they assume that the input is informative in some way). might be worth going back later if I ever need to refresh on some relevant developmental psychology vis-a-vis probabilistic modeling, which I was vaguely familiar with and didn't flashcard since I don't work much with children.
      - [[http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3711-perceptual-multistability-as-markov-chain-monte-carlo-inference.pdf][Perceptual Multistability as Markov Chain Monte Carlo Inference]] perceptual instabilities (think the necker cube illusion) can be modeled by MCMC methods. This paper was in NIPS 2009! Back when this conference was more cogsci-ish, I suppose.
      - [[http://colala.berkeley.edu/papers/piantadosi2012bootstrapping.pdf][Bootstrapping in a language of thought: A formal model of numerical concept learning]] 2012 paper which models children number-concept learning as a simple lambda calculus program (which knows either small sets or the more complicated generative rule) in order to argue the /bootstrapping/ theory of Carey 2009 is easily formally modeled and explains the development of children quite accurately. These kids papers are always great when they include quotes. "E: What if I told you there was a number after a million and ninety nine? A million one hundred." "D.S: Well, I wish there was a million and one hundred, but there isn't."
      - [[http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/predictions.pdf][Optimal Predictions in Everyday Cognition]] alluded to in How to grow a Mind; when given a vague question like "if you meet someone that is 60 years old, how much longer will they live" people seem to naturally gravitate towards the right distributions (i.e. gaussians for lifespans, power law distributions for box office grossing, etc) for their predictions. Amusing that they had to dump out the marriage question because 52% of the respondents said the marriages would last forever, roughly equal to the proportion of non-divorced marriages, but couldn't average "forever" with anything to get an accurate median. Uncovering this sort of distribution with aggregate intuition is probably why prediction markets are usually pretty effective predictors despite only some proportion of the predictors being "superforecasters"
      - [[http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/Tauber_Steyvers_CogSci2013%2520-%2520FINAL%2520REVISION.pdf][Inferring Subjective Prior Knowledge: An Integrative Bayesian Approach]] GT 2006 showed that people's models of stuff like lifespan / movie lengths is well-tuned to the real world, but people keep using it to claim priors equal to the real world - how does it hold up when you give them a fantasy question (i.e. lifespans in 2075)? This methodology can't be used, you can't assume the prior (+ it could just be different). Tauber and Steyvers use an integrative approach to infer if the environmental prior was normal, erlang, or pareto distributed, and were able to mostly faithfully reproduce GT 2006 along with infer a new distribution around the fantasy age question despite no environmental data to fit it with.
      - [[http://cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf][Minds, Brains, and Programs (Searle 1980)]] the original Chinese Room thought experiment paper. Worth reading for the history. I think that where this errs is that it tries to ascribe agency to any particular part of the system, rather than to the entire system, /even though they are not isomorphic/, which is the key thing missing from his commentary. An equivalent question would be something like "imagine you are a single neuron, and you get a bunch of inputs and produce specific outputs according to specific rules. You live in the fusiform face area, but you don't actually know what faces look like, ergo you have no understanding of faces, ergo neurons don't understand faces, ergo you can't actually perceive faces" which obviously doesn't work - you are attributing intentionality to the component and not to the system, and the system is what actually does the "understanding", which Searle just waves away as "[[https://www.theproofistrivial.com/][obviously ridiculous]]".
      - [[http://web.mit.edu/tger/www/papers/How,%2520whether,%2520why%2520Causal%2520judgments%2520as%2520counterfactual%2520contrasts,%2520Gerstenberg%2520et%2520al.,%25202015.pdf][How, whether, why: Causal judgments as counterfactual contrasts (Gerstenberg et al)]] Proposes /counterfactual simulation model/ as a means of explaining how people make causal judgements, split into /whether causes/ (removing would change the outcome) and /how causes/ (perturbation would have changed the outcome) and uses billiards as a means of differentiating these two. Includes sufficiency and robustness as factors, although only the former provided explanatory power. People roughly simulate situations like these using vaguely newtonian physics, and can imagine how things work if things are changed in the scene.
      - [[http://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/09/descriptive-vs-optimal-bayesian-modeling.html][Descriptive vs optimal bayesian modeling]] "suboptimality" in bayesian modeling to better fit human data; you can give up on optimality in bayesian modeling and still make use of the framework to describe cognition. Discusses a "data discounting" parameter, along with some thoughts on replication case studies in the TNPS paper.
      - [[https://web.stanford.edu/~ngoodman/papers/GerstenbergGoodman2012.pdf][Ping Pong in Church (Gerstenberg and Goodman 2012)]] using probabilistic programming to make inferences about tournament results given sparse amounts of information (a topic very near to my heart, as anyone that knows me knows). Uses very toy examples with very few players, but "Probabilistic Language of Thought" matches human intuition despite very limited amount of information (i.e. A beats B, and B beats C and D, so A is probably pretty good). Interested to see if this sort of approach scales much further beyond four players, perhaps something to look into myself.
      - [[https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/GouldLewontin.pdf][The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian program: A critique of the adaptationist programme (S.J. Gould 1979)]] Senseless adaptationism is no different from saying inane stuff like "noses are the perfect shape for glasses, so we must have evolved to wear glasses." The causality is directly backwards; just because something is /used/ for something, does not necessarily mean it was /evolved/ for /that specific use/ (sexual selection for blushing doesn't tell us why blood is red). Plus, it's not really falsifiable; it's just a fun story. "[he said] it was obvious that the delicate mouths of the [sweat] glands required the protection given to them by the [fingerprint] ridges on either side of them... I replied that his arguments were beautiful and deserved to be true, but it happened that the mouths of the ducts did not run in the valleys between the crests, but along the crests of the ridges themselves."

Some notes on the ad-hoc-ness of IQ e.g. how it does well but only really within groups, not between them.
****** Machine Learning
       - [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10154.pdf][Please Stop Explaining Black Box Models for High-Stakes Decisions]] Explainable ML is overrated. Explanations are dimensionality reductions, and necessarily lose information (lest they be the entirety of the model). Corporations making profits from black-box models is a problem, and truly interpetable models are rare because they need to be human-parsable and also hold up to expert analysis, which nobody making these things actually has. Gives some (somewhat naive) possible solutions to this problem.

****** Miscallany
       - [[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-06/jdc-pbf061919.php][Performance-enhancing bacteria found in the microbiomes of elite athletes]] Venillonella is a bacteria which eats lactic acid (which is produced from exercise) and creates propionate, which is a short-chain fatty acid typically produced after eating fiber. Researcher found this bacteria was way more common in marathoners, started selling capsules with the bacteria in it. Is this a performance enhancing drug? Interesting to think about the implications.
       - [[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/opinion/what-do-we-actually-know-about-the-economy-wonkish.html][What Do We Actually Know About the Economy? (Wonkish)]] A fun read about the predictive power of macroeconomics and the relative shortcomings of microeconomics, and about how microeconomics fails to paint a clear picture of human behavior. "Rational behavior" is more of a thought experiment than a good reflection of reality. "Data can never absolve you from the necessity of having theories". I am admittedly a bit out of my depth reading an opinion piece on econ, but it was a decent read nonetheless.

      - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbDZcycnhni0][How does Spanish Buzz Lightyear sound in Spanish?]] a wonderful demonstration of linguistic distance! The joke is the same in all three versions, but the execution necessarily needs to be more dramatic in each version lest the joke be lost in the similarity.

Funny that his tug-of-war algorithm is just a probabilistic program which implements trueskill! Also interesting is the claim that making inferences on inferences makes programs "social" in some way. Claims connection to deep learning (!) to use deep learning to learn to do inference (see [[http://webppl.org/demos/vines/index.html][vine/electric generation demo]]).

*** June 2019
**** Updates
     - *Climbed 5 V4 Boulder Problems* I feel good about my climbing lately - here's a [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1137803513550036993][video]].
     - *I read a lot of papers now* Unlike before, I couldn't possibly hope to record all my notes on papers I read without this document becoming prohibitively long (it's already starting to grow substantially), so from now on I will only be putting on this page my notes on papers I thought were particularly interesting that month. 
**** Goals for July
     - Work through Probabilistic Models of Cognition
     - Read voraciously, work hard
     - Better outline my short- and medium-term learning goals and resources
**** Things I've Made / Obtained
     - Deeplearning.ai Certificates - [[./images/misc/01-deeplearningai.pdf][01]] [[./images/misc/03-deeplearningai.pdf][03]] [[./images/misc/03-deeplearningai.pdf][03]] [[./images/misc/04-deeplearningai.pdf][04]] [[./images/misc/05-deeplearningai.pdf][05]] [[./images/misc/deeplearningai_spec.pdf][Specialization]] Turns out you can get these certificates after auditing the course, which means I managed to obtain all of these during the 7-day free trial. I figured it couldn't hurt to get these if they were free, so I did so.
**** Things I've Consumed
***** MOOCs
      - [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list%3DPLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ][Deepmind - Introduction to Reinforcement Learning]] 10 part lecture series on RL from [[http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Home.html][David Silver]], the lead researcher for alphago (what more could you possibly ask for?). Silver explains things quite well and it's very obvious he has a very deep knowledge of the subject matter - when he is confronted with a question from a student during these lectures he virtually always immediately understands the questions and gives a well-forumulated, complete answer.
***** Books
      - [[https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00429ED1V01Y201207AIM018][Active Learning (Burr Settles)]] a survey book on the relatively sparse field of Active Learning. As such, a very short book, but I was extremely impressed by the clarity and readability of it, and would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to learn about the field. Most researchers cite this book and zero other works when writing anything about Active Learning, and considering it's readable in a single focused afternoon it's probably worth reading if you have any interest in the field at all.
***** Papers
      - [[https://weightagnostic.github.io/][Weight Agnostic Neural Networks]] Another hardmaru paper, which means it's an insane paper with excellent interactive visualization. Literally baffled that they get 90%+ on MNIST with literally completely random weights. Would be really surprised if this doesn't win best paper at NeurIPS (assuming it was submitted).
      - [[https://marcodgdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/delgiudice_invisible-designers_pre.pdf][Invisible Designers: Brain Evolution Through the Lens of Parasite Manipulation]] "How much of our neural complexity is a necessary defense against manipulative invaders? How much of the enormous redundancy is to provide system level functionality if part of the system is attacked? How much of the complex process of wiring a brain during development is to prevent pathogen re-wiring?" Claims complex animal brains evolved robustness and strong defense due to selection pressure from parasites - the blood-brain barrier to restrict access to the brain, decoy molecules to trick parasites into binding something useless, increasing the costs of manipulation, increasing the complexity of signals, etc. Animal brains can perform a sort of targeted dropout when they detect that their activations are unusual in some way (as a means of foiling manipulation).
      - [[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7e4/bc08c9c746fda4721ac9e2206b4472e44b85.pdf?_ga%3D2.74605330.1449771210.1560900451-1193061941.1559447435][How To Grow a Mind]] and [[https://techtv.mit.edu/videos/9f656eda702dd387b80edc022d6468d1262aac36/private][MIT Seminar]] on the same topic; it feels good to read work in cognitive science again, and I think I am going to direct my learning in this sort of computational cogsci direction. You can model lots of types of behavior pretty well with typical bayesian analysis, one interesting idea being the idea that if you have a single example of things in a known super-category (i.e. one cow, which is an animal) then you can reason that it's probably close to other cows in a similar way that sheep are close to other sheep. You can find the best structure for different problems!
      - [[http://vision.ucsf.edu/dunnlab/Platt1964.pdf][Strong Inference (Platt 1964)]] you can make much faster progress through uncharted territory if you rigidly iterate between hypothesizing, designing experiments, and executing the experiments. Argues most scientists just do random bs and write as if they knew steps 1, 2, and 3 all along. "The difference between the average scientist's informal methods and the methods of the strong-inference users is somewhat like the difference between a gasoline engine that fires occasionally and one that fires in steady sequence. If our motorboat engines were as erratic as our deliberate intellectual efforts, most of us would not get home for supper" (ouch!)
      - [[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p3105ed][The Head and The Hands (Koenderink 2002)]] Some cool thoughts on research practices of "thinking with your head" and "thinking with your hands", i.e. theorizing and experimenting, and how people often dramatically prefer one to the other. Interesting contrast with Platt's strong inference paper. I think the takeaway here is that both of these are pretty important; if you think about the scientific method as an english version of bayes' theorem, sometimes you just need to open the door a few times to give yourself any sort of prior at all.
      - [[https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id%3D10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&type%3Dprintable][Why Most Published Research Findings are False (Ionnidis 2005)]] on the replication crisis. Research findings are more likely to be false if the sample size is small, the effect size is small, the greater number / lesser selection of tested relationships, the relationships are handwavey (i.e. "condition worsens"), the greater financial interests exists, and the hotter a scientific field is (please see: artificial intelligence). The title is, perhaps, deliberately provocative, but all of this just follows from the /definitions/ of p-values and statistical power (the latter of which is usually ignored), so you should pay attention and remember to do your bonferonni corrections, etc. "a finding from a well-conducted adequately powered randomized controlled trial starting with a 50% pre-study chance that intervention is effective is eventually true about 85% of the time" (!). Argues we should stop chasing statistical significance and spend more time understanding the range of R values (i.e. priors).
      - [[http://ling.umd.edu/~idsardi/728/Marr/Marr%2520%2527Vision%2527%2520Ch%25201.pdf][Vision - Marr’s Levels of Analysis]] "In the 1960s almost no one realized that machine vision was difficult... the idea that extracting edges and lines from images might be at all difficult simply did not occur to those who had not tried to do it."   "Trying to understand perception by studying only neurons is like trying to understand bird flight by studying only feathers: it simply cannot be done."
      - [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232512003_Fuzzy_methodology][Fuzzy Methodology (Cohen 1992)]] a quick two-pager about a psychologist with a relatively important publication that almost tossed the whole thing because statisticians told him his methodology was trivial and lacked rigor. Cohen's contribution wasn't the methodology (which was, after all, trivial and fuzzy) but the bridging of two fields in a novel way. "obsessed by the issue of statistical significance, for a quantitative science, psychology has a remarkably low level of awareness of just how big the phenomena with which it deals." Advice for publications: 1. be brilliant, 2. write on methodology, 3. write to answer a widely felt need, 4. be lucky (useful for AI conferences, also, "rub a rabbit's foot as you drop your manuscript into the mailbox"). Cognitive Science might make you self-conscious from being learned in many fields but not necessarily world-expert in all of them, but you can frame this more positively as harnessing /Shoshin/.
      - [[http://www.fpce.uc.pt/niips/area_ps/disci/mips/McGuire_1997.pdf][Creative Hypothesis Generating in Psychology (Cohen 1992)]] Heuristics for generating hypotheses (through the lens of psychology), broadly split into five categories: deliberately noticing provocative natural occurences, direct inference, mediated inference, reinterpreting existing research, and analyses on data, further subdivided into subcategories containing specific heuristics (nice table on page 4-5). Not all of these apply to every researcher but a useful read to think about how you generate your own hypotheses and if you're too strongly limiting the /actual ways/ in which you come up with your ideas (e.g. only after reading tons of things about the topic). Amusing was Heuristic G22 - physiological prod to jolt one's thinking - in which he discusses using substances to alter your thinking to allow you to come up with more ideas, something no doubt inspired by Paul Erdos' morbidly amusing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%25C5%2591s#Personality][amphetamine use]].

      - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DLGd8p-GSLgY][The Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness]] so far the most interesting of the lectures I've seen from the CBMM youtube channel. Lays out a framework for "grading" the consciousness of graphs, and notably feedforward networks have a consciousness score of 0 due to the lack of self-reference. Claims within this framework that full-brain emulation in a computer would also be non-conscious despite perfect emulation and behavioral capturing, since the underlying representation will be computable with a turing machine and thereby is no different than simulating the weather would make the inside of your computer wet.

**** Goals for June

     - *Climb five V4 boulder problems*
     - *Learn some rudimentary Reinforcement Learning*
**** Things I've Made
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/coolness.html][Novelty Dispersion]] Phenomenon I've noticed in people who create things, that I figured was frequent enough for me to name and write about.
**** Things I've Consumed
     - [[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source%3Ddeeplearningai&utm_medium%3Dinstitutions&utm_campaign%3DWebsiteCoursesDLSTopButton][deeplearning.ai - Deep Learning Specialization]] I completed courses 1,2,3, and 5 this month. I feel like I got a lot out of taking all of these courses (they took me about a month to get through all 5, although I had the luxury of a lot of time to spend on it), and I think Andrew Ng's teaching style is very clear and he gets the big-picture ideas into the student relatively quickly, which I appreciated about these lectures. I think Ng glosses over a huge body of information in an effort to make the course more approachable, but it ends up being a giant meme (don't worry if you don't understand this / backprop is the most complicated thing in all of deep learning / if you're an expert in calculus you'll know the definition of derivatives, but don't worry if you aren't / etc). I think most of this course is taught at roughly a high school level (maybe for a student concurrently taking calculus if you want to really get all the little details), so I'd probably recommend this as a starting point for someone interested in AI. I sorta regret taking course 4 and 5 before 1,2, and 3, but it didn't dramatically affect my experience either way and I got tons of anki flashcards out of it regardless. Onto the next resource!

**** Goals for May
     - *Become as good at your job as possible*
     - *Adjust to new lifestyle*
**** Things I've Been a Part of Making
- [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1121263801649762304][I went to a local and had fun at said local]] I'm really cool and I have a fun hobby
- [[https://twitter.com/Savestate/status/1112682814779076608][Savestate's April Fools Joke]] I played a part in this joke which was hilarious especially considering several people were in on the joke to "reproduce" it, behind the scenes [[https://twitter.com/Savestate/status/1112927842919202816][here]]
**** Things I've Consumed
- [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/home/welcome][deeplearning.ai - Convolutional Neural Networks]] a brief foray into MOOCs, started here mostly for the videos on YOLO but ended up watching the entire course as a result of enjoying Andrew Ng's teaching style, which I think is pretty clear. I just audit the course since the actual certificate strikes me as exceedingly useless, but perhaps this attitude is what is preventing MOOCs from taking off so maybe I'm just a part of the problem
- [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2799985050?book_show_action=false][Machine Learning Yearning - Andrew Ng]] disappointing, and especially devastatingly disappointing when you realize who the author is. Perhaps I was just no longer in the target audience for this book but I don't really think I can grasp someone who would be - it seems to be aimed at startups trying to deploy ML solutions (?) but I think feels weirdly too intro for anybody who would be able to actually do that. It is a draft though, so perhaps I'm being too harsh
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tod2qZnKZEQ][The Dolly Zoom]] Weirdly engaging for a video about a certain kind of zoom - really neat!
- [[https://worldmodels.github.io/][World Models]] absolutely psycho interesting paper that appeals to the cognitive scientist and fledgling AI researcher in me; training entirely on hallucination is really fascinating and I was really excited by a lot of different ideas in this project, for example adjusting the temperature parameter to make the hallucinations more difficult than the actual task, thus making training more useful. Just read it, it's really digestible.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puAuDt6aNsw][Howl's Moving Castle Theme for Solo Piano - Kyle Landry]] I loved this arrangement because it for how bombastic it was compared to the original I think it did what it set out to do pretty much perfectly -- bring forward a backgroundy OST piece to the foreground for solo piano. So much energy! I love it.

*** March 2019
**** Goals for April
     - *Continue Reading*
     - *Relocate, Start New Job*

     - *[[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1110350992229494785][What is the most obscure thing you know about in Melee?]]* cool twitter thread which yielded ~100 responses of cool obscure little things about melee.
     - *[[https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ambisinister][Recalibrated Myanimelist]]* I went back and adjusted all my ratings / added a bunch of things I had forgotten to record that I watched. Still not perfect and probably requires some rewatching to get correct, but it was a good thing to do considering most of the anime I've watched recently has been depressingly mediocre.
**** Things I've Consumed
     - *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Steps][Baby Steps]]* Reread this from start to finish to get myself super hyped up for this new era in my life. This sort of media I think is really good as a motivational pick-me-up and I've long believed that reading things at the right time can influence you positively, which is why I think it's important to remember how consuming different media makes you feel.

These two series are very impressive in different ways for me; the calculus one was mostly "oh that's why that's that way" moments for me while watching it, whereas the linear algebra one was a beautiful visual overview of something that was before mostly symbolic in my head. I'm really excited for his Differential Equations series, which should be coming out shortly.
     - *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dd4EgbgTm0Bg][3B1B - Quaternions]]* and the corresponding *[[https://eater.net/quaternions][Visualizing quaternions]]* page - probably a little bit over my head but the basic ideas are really interesting, in particular the bit about calculating 3d rotations with these was pretty sick.

     - *Spend some time on organization* I've let my organization escape me a little bit so it'll be good to spend a little time to get everything back in place.

**** Things I've Made
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/personainsmash.html][Predicting Personality with Playstyle in Super Smash Brothers]] People have been kicking around this question for ages so I did some research to get to the bottom of it.

**** Things I've Made
     - [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/visualdistance.html][Locating Visual Jokes in Homestuck with Rudimentary Computer Vision]] probably the fastest I've ever completed a project of this rigor, which was really exciting! The project took me about a month and a half and I was really committed to completing it before the year ended, which I thankfully was able to accomplish. Definitely among the more technically interesting projects I've done, performed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/aas7fb/locating_visual_jokes_in_homestuck_with/][moderately well]] on the /r/homestuck subreddit.

**** Reflections

The links page has become, weirdly enough, one of my favorite projects. I'm reminded of a suggestion I heard a long time ago (I think it was from Day9 but I am unsure) to keep a journal full of awesome things you have done so you can look back at it whenever you feel down about yourself. It's really cool being able to flip through and at a glance see where all your time in a year went, which months were strong and which were weak, etc. 

A useful thing I can do here is briefly reflect on 2018 and how it squared with what my goals were for the year:

I read 11/30 books, 9 reviewed on [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25277520-eryk-banatt][my goodreads page]], one being a re-read (Once a Runner), and one being Anokh's /The Book of Melee/ which I obviously won't review extensively due to it being currently unreleased.

I wrote 7 longform posts on this website (Homestuck CV, STARS ALIGNED annotations, Celeste Review, Anki notes, Projects page, Boredom Types rant, Making Sense of Melee), I made 6 videos (Shinelock Punishes, Box Practical Tech, Bombs over Battlefield, Shine 2018 Clips, STARS ALIGNED, Stray Saturday), I made semi-regular appearances on the /Melee Stats Podcast/, and I revamped this website to be a lot more efficient (i.e. easier to read, mobile friendly, auto-generated from org mode documents, better in general overall). My original goal was just "15 longform posts" which I set rather aggressively to encourage shorter writings (i.e. ones that don't require months of work like Making Sense of Melee, the Homestuck CV project, STARS ALIGNED and it's annotations etc) so I it'll be okay if I cheat a little bit and consider this goal met just via converting quantity of work from one format to another.

I'm unsure if I'd consider myself the fittest I've ever been but I've made some substantial progress on that front and I'm pretty satisfied with that. I think I need to learn how to balance the different types of training into somethat that works for me because it's hard to me to juggle everything (e.g. I stop running if I go to the gym more, I stop going to the gym if I focus on rock climbing, etc). 

I think overall I'm pleased with how I was able to focus on goals I defined myself throughout 2018. I had a lot to show for my use of free time in 2018, and probably are most proud of [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ambistats.html][these]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DOGpB5d5nuPg][three]] [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/visualdistance.html][projects]]. I think I could've done more - in particular there are two projects I started that fell through mostly due to my decision to focus on Melee a bit more during the summer (between EVO / Shine / Big House / etc). Likewise I didn't do anywhere near enough reading, at least as far as books go. I was mostly good about staying on task but there were a few months where I felt like I accomplished almost nothing. These were generally in the summer, and in general I found it difficult to get back into the swing of independent work after doing any sort of travelling. 

Anyways, 2019 goals:
- Dramatically restructure life to spend higher percentage of time doing things I find interesting instead of just a few hours a day
- Complete 15 projects, four of them being "large projects", at least five of them including a longform writing component
- Read 20 books
- Become strong


*** November 2018
**** Brief Updates
     - *Started some cool things but haven't completed them*

"I wish to clarify that an inherent danger of climbing the social ladder in small communities is that a player can lose sight of the intense sway that they hold. Even falsities can be accepted by the weaker party when enough people gather around the stronger individual. Those with high capital should seek to view discourse in light of their own authority, and consider whether or not their opinion is actually correct or if their authority has preceded them."

**** Brief Updates
     - *Attended The Big House 8* got 97th place which is pretty solid for me; I can be so much better than I currently am and I have lots of footage to review. In general this low-pressure headspace I was in was very good and is worth experimenting with more. [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list%3DPLczW29iRM_QdoOL7Oy4bm0b6-BCkmSlCz][bracket matches]]
     - *Updated the iframe CSS on this website* Youtube videos / gfycats no longer look completely stupid, nor are they insanely vertically stretched on mobile.
     - *Began taking Creatine* been thinking about taking this since I’ve heard mixed things about its effect on cognition (mostly during sleep deprivation) but now that I’m lifting weights 3x/week I figured it was worth taking regularly. Hard to separate out what is from creatine and what is from just getting stronger, but the water retention effect was much stronger than I anticipated.

      - [[https://www.deltarune.com/][deltarune - Chapter 1]] Very cute, and I think a surprisingly worthy followup to UNDERTALE so far. May or may not be part of a big writeup I'm planning, but my impressions after chapter 1 are: absolutely fire [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DeeXFCM1e-zM][OST]], overall somewhat less lovable characters but some [[https://twitter.com/Ambisinister_/status/1058158724290879493][gems]], the Suzy/Lance dynamic was hilarious and cute, the linear storytelling is a big departure and makes me think we're in for a ride (and probably a dark one), it's free??, the ending caught me entirely off guard, can't wait for chapter 2.

      - [[https://bignokh.com/][The Book of Melee]] I was an alpha reader for Anokh Palakurthi's Melee upcoming 2019 nonfiction book chronicling the history of SSBM.

*** September 2018
**** Goals for October
     - *Go to The Big House 8* just have a good time, stop worrying so much about how you perform when you can't even go to locals.
     - *Lift weights again* need to get back on a beginner program and get back to where I was before. I'm not exactly untrained (I do still climb) but I'm not where I used to be and I realized I got complacent with my health goals after I lost the weight I gained second half of school.
     - *Read books* I'd like to finish Psychology Applied to Modern Life at minimum, preferably more.
     - *Finish 2-3 of my mostly finished projects* this includes my Celeste longform review, the secret video project, and the stamina bracket research, among other stray ones.

*** July 2018
**** Brief Updates
- *Sent a V3 Problem* Didn't get a video recording of it, but I sent an interesting slab problem at The Gravity Vault in Randor, PA. In my send I got stuck on the last move for maybe three full minutes before getting past it with a weird coordination mantle + pistol squat move, which I felt really good about even though it suggests my move into the last move was probably not super optimal.
- *Sent another, different V3 Problem* Video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dzvj-iehyW9g][here]], another relatively easy problem which I abused my height to make easier. I want to send this cleaner (as I did with that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4rmQWE4jCbY][super weird teal V2]] that everyone at my gym hates, myself included). I really liked the mini cut-loose move near the end but I think this climb would be easier with better footwork especially after the third hand move (flag is unnecessary). I think a footswap after the fifth hand move -> move right foot to hold right next to it skips the need for cutting loose, but I could be misunderstanding how good the holds are from that position from this video. Overall I think definitely a relatively easy v3 which I think is appropriate for what I consider my current level at climbing (V2+/V3-)
- *Practiced a bunch for Evo 2018* I'm very excited for this event and I think I'm in pretty good form for it - I'm unsure if I'll do well or not but I'm looking forward to playing a lot of great melee with strong players and having a good time in Las Vegas.

**** Goals for August
- *Play Well at Evo 2018, get hours in against new, strong players*
- *Send two more V3s, one of which must be a roof/overhang* 
- *Cut weight back down to 150-153 range*
- *Resume work on programming work*
- *Begin work on secret SSBM video project*

*** June 2018 
**** Goals for July
- *Send another V3 Problem* I have one that I'm working on but I am worried they will take it down before I get the last move, so if I can't get it by the end of the month then I'll need to find something else
- *Practice an unreasonable amount for Evo 2018* It's probably because I can no longer take Melee for granted and play it every day, but I haven't felt this motivated for a tournament in a very long time. I really want to perform well so I've been practicing a lot and I don't want to let this motivation fizzle out before the event.
- *Work on projects when you have time* I have a lot of things in the works, among which the things I have not finished from months ago, but my priorities have temporarily shifted for now so I think if I finish any real projects in the next month I'll view it as a bonus rather than an explicit goal.
**** Things I have Made
- [[http://planetbanatt.net][Overhauled personal website]] I now generate this entire website from emacs org files; going back and transforming all my html documents to org files was sort of a pain but luckily with pandoc it didn't take longer than an afternoon - the rough part was wrangling with the org html export, which I eventually managed to nail down. It looks cool now! Still some work to be done but not bad.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsdz2mTnhfM][V3 Boulder Problem]] interesting mantle -> mantle thing going on in this problem; it feels a little easy for a V3 but I'm not complaining since it let me meet my goal for this month!

     - *Complete Bracket Stamina post* (this has gone on for too long as it is, since I keep encountering cool things abour it, and I made less progress than I would've liked on it despite working on it for ~20ish hours this month, but a lot of that is due to the fact that I am learning emacs through this project; I think I'm mostly completed with interesting things to encounter so I expect to be completed by mid may)
     - *Become very comfortable with emacs*; a friend of mine showed me his emacs setup and I realized that I had virtually the same workflow except strewn across 15 different programs and within two weeks of using it I am back/surpassing to my old productivity speed despite regularly pausing to remember how to perform the "copy" command. Fully expect to sink 300+ hours into configuring this program within the next year but as it stands I am already hooked on it.

Health

-  finished a two month trial period for
   [[https://examine.com/supplements/bacopa-monnieri/][Bacopa
   Monnieri]]. Ended up observing a rise in correct answers for new +
   young anki cards of about 8%, and no change in mature cards. I didn't
   do any blinding, and would probably have to revisit this if I wanted
   to explore it deeply in any capacity. I don't really feel like bacopa
   gave me anything super valuable given the magnitude of the effect, so
   I've discontinued taking it (although I might consider taking it
   again if I ever decide to become a student again). Funny to think
   about how effectively you can replace the use of short term memory
   with good external capturing like anki or Evernote.

SSBM

-  spent virtually my entire month practicing backwards aerial drift.
   Entered a tournament and placed pretty well despite feeling pretty
   off tech-skill wise. Feel good about practice paying off somewhat for
   me.

Misc

-  Decided against adding an RSS feed, since adding one for a static
   website is more trouble than it's worth and I have a far too small
   readership that would ever use it.
-  Met most of my goals from last month (only finished 2 books but did a
   lot of reading), still need some calibration but enough of my time
   went towards practicing melee that I had a slightly below average
   level of productivity

A pretty interesting look at how different teams perform at different

Trading - Ambition, Deception, Honor, Redemption: The story of the
biggest heist in Eve's history]] Half chilling, half fascinating - Eve
Online scammer details how he ran a ponzi scheme disguised as a
fraudulent trading corporation in-game, eventually leading to him making
away with 30 billion isk (A few thousand dollars). There's a lot of
really amusing anecdotes in here (he claims he didn't sell the isk for
real money because he didn't want to break the terms of service, he
mentions the playerbase revolting after the moderators returned money
from a different scam, and that he had intended to return as much of it
as possible before being mistakenly banned and changing his mind upon
the reversal), and it reads like a wild criminal testimonial for someone
who knows he's not going to face any repercussions. In the end he blew
the whistle on another scammer, the EVE Interstellar Bank, a scam that
netted /that/ scammer 750 billion isk (~$80k USD).

"those who did not make specific requests, and instead asked open-ended
questions like "how can I trust you?" and "how do I know this is for
real?"--these were future investors. They were asking me to persuade
them. They wanted to believe."

"People who posted on the forums seemed to have a negative attitude
about everything. Rather than being a cross-section of the Eve populace,
the forums were populated by a group disparagingly known as "the forum
superstars"--people who spent all their time on the forums instead of
actually playing the game. Not only did they have a fame and influence
far out of proportion to their playing abilities, they were accused of
getting special treatment from the administrators of the Eve servers.
But it was their persistent scorn for anyone making anything new--and
their seeming inability to make their own positive contributions to the
game--that maintained the ordinary players' low regard for them."

"In the end, I decided that the only value in having stolen all of that
isk was not the isk itself, but the stealing of it. I wanted to see if I
could do the impossible, and I did it. The more I pondered the actual
value of isk, the more I saw that the only people who really valued it
were the ones who had earned it themselves. Despite Eve being a game,
they had put real work into it. Many of them had spent three years
shooting rocks and hauling modules around to earn that isk, and now it
would be gone."

"Only now did I appreciate just how insidious a scam could be. I had
thought the isk meant nothing to me. That it was just a means to an end,
a score to beat. But now I was willing to wreak devastation upon all of
my investors just to hold onto it. The scam had scammed me. It stole my
concern for others and replaced it with gluttony. I was disgusted. I
lied. I cheated people. I used people to help me scam their friends. I
was the cause of widespread bankruptcy. But the most damning thing of
all? I think I can live with it, and if I had it to do all over again, I
would. To my surprise, a guilty conscience was a small price to pay for
thirty billion isk. So I will learn to live with it, because I can live
with it."

-  Tentatively added Disqus comments to my writings - fully prepared to
   reevaluate this later and conclude it was a bad idea but I've been
   meaning to have a means of people sharing their ideas with me without
   needing to contact me on social media so this seems like a worthy try
-  also added google analytics, which I did not do before my statistics
   post and kicked myself for - it'll be useful to check what kind of
   audience I have for everything
-  Couldn't think of use for Raspberry Pi, Didn't get around to adding

project where I gathered tons of tournament sets and examined trends in

this post details my further scrutinizing of the patterns within. The
post got a lot more attention than I was expecting! (It got something

paper which suggests that most people are actually impressively
resilient after aversive events. Because so many people that show up to
clinicians after bad things happen are in need of clinicians to help
them, the prevailing view was that when bad things happen to people they
usually need time to grieve. However, the sample size was very
self-selecting here, and exploring more "normal" baselines suggest its
possible that on average people are pretty good about staying functional
through traumatic events.

the structure and despite it being a little wonky at first it made the

randomly due to weird level geometry problems, having issues with the

could get by BLJing past walls instead of actually earning them. I had
fun with it, but I couldn't manage to 100% it because there were just
some stars that were so broken that I got too frustrated to continue
playing. It made me appreciate how relatively not broken the original
game was, and how important beta testing is for these sorts of games.

anything, grab doesn't lead to anything, so what are you going for in
neutral against luigi? What's your gameplan? I ended up just going for
random hits and getting steamrolled). Takeaways: uptilt vs nairs, dash
attack is a common mixup situation (nair out jump out etc), usually
avoid midrange (close/far is good), Disjoints are good (uptilt, falling
upair). Being above luigi is very good. Empty drill into fullhop is
pretty good because you can punish grab attempts with falling upair.

help them with the documentary. However, it turns out that the person
that claimed to be Magus was actually somebody impersonating Magus,
having done so for months and knowing intimate information that
"verified" their identity with other dev team members. Nobody knows who
this person was, or how they knew so much about Magus and the internal

Syndrome" where they are capable of winning because of their superior
"biology" rather than actually outplaying their opponents, and as such I
don't think these are particularly useful as training tools (I.e. A
"winning position" for the AI is not necessarily winning for a human, if
such a situation requires something like frame perfect reaction time,
and attempting to emulate its playstyle would likely be extremely
foolish, unlike with Deep Blue or AlphaGo. For games with a biological
element [Melee, Dota, Jeopardy] emulating realistic biology is important
before you can announce "triumph" over human players.)

the paper's conclusion is that powerful (correlation between a
preference + big 5 feels pretty unimportant) I think the methodology was
great.

/Berlitz Complete Japanese/ A good series of dialogues to introduce
basic Japanese grammar (I'm still very much a beginner but I imagine
this is all N5 level). The dialogues are charming enough to keep you
reasonably engaged - I found myself more amused than I ought to be
listening to Harrison-san's antics, which I think is a good thing for
this type of resource. The dialogues are completely in Japanese, which
is what I wanted, but things become confusing if you can't figure out
what words mean so this might be worth supplementing with another
textbook, a dictionary, or the workbook. There's some weirdness
(pronouncing wo particle actually as "wo" sometimes) but overall good to
listen to if you want to practice listening/speaking

/Introductory Statistics with R/ A book that I think is best suited
either with a teacher or with another, more traditional, statistics
textbook. Using R has proven very useful, but the book was heavy with
jargon that it did not explain properly, and I frequently felt lost
despite making flashcards and reading very carefully. Certain concepts
are vaguely explained or not explained at all, and you're expected to
have a minimum level of knowledge that I felt was inappropriate given
that it also explained really basic stuff like factorials. Overall a
useful book that added a good tool to my toolkit, but one that
frequently had me googling things for clarification.

/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria_(manga)][Aria]]/ Slow, relaxing,
with some basic scifi concepts, works better as a manga than an anime
due to pacing. Fits the genre of "utopia that isn't a utopia", everyone
just sort of lazily goes about their days and most of the story is
literally about being able to slow down and admire the scenery around
you (MC's entire personality type, as well as the job of the Primas).

/[[https://www.gwern.net/Aria%27s%20past,%20present,%20and%20future][Aria's
Past, Present, and Future (Gwern)]]/ Hilarious, I've always had a soft
spot for violating suspension of disbelief and then trying to explain it
away using crazy theories. Reminds me a lot of the
"[[http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Matrix_in_a_Matrix_theory][Matrix in a
Matrix]]" theory, where people plugged the ridiculous left-field plot
hole of Matrix Reloaded as evidence that, since Neo can use powers in
the "real world", it's likely not the real world - just another layer of
fabrication that Neo pulled his punches in because he didn't believe he
had powers in there. Probably false, but a fun way to engage with plot
holes!

/Koe no Katachi (2016)/ - I think as good of a film adaptation as I
could have reasonably expected from condensing this rather long story
into a two hour film. Pacing issues that were not present in the manga,
parts felt extremely rushed due to cutting out some smaller arcs to make
time. Characters didn't have enough time to properly develop into
believable characters with the exception of the main character, again a
byproduct of lack of time. Where this film shines is sound direction, it
uses silence and white noise extremely well, which compliments the films
themes (hearing vs listening / blocking out the world / etc). The
animation is fantastic as well, Kyoto Animation delivers as you might
expect. Overall not quite as good as the manga adaptation, but not bad
by any means.
