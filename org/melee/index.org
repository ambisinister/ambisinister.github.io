Hello, I am the green fox from twitter!

My tag is [[https://liquipedia.net/smash/Ambisinister][Ambisinister]] (adj. Clumsy or Unskilled with both hands), but most people just call me Ambi. I'm fairly active in a bunch of places in the scene - I'm a [[https://www.start.gg/tournament/genesis-8/event/melee-singles/entrant/7890962][competitor]], a [[https://www.youtube.com/c/MeleeStats][content creator]], a recurring guest on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkwn6t2YOPo][various melee podcasts]], data lead of [[https://liquipedia.net/smash/SSBMRank][SSBMRank]], and the founder of [[http://planetbanatt.net/images/syalelogo.jpg][Smash @ Yale]], among other things. I love the game and the scene very much, so you'll see me poke my head in a lot of places if you spend entirely too much time looking around. My best result would probably placing [[https://www.start.gg/tournament/genesis-8/event/melee-singles/entrant/7890962][49th out of 1552 at Genesis 8]].

** Links To Stuff For Getting Good

*** My Stuff

Here's some stuff I built for myself. I don't know if any of it will be useful for you, but maybe some of it is interesting.

[[https://planetbanatt.net/vods/index.html][Vods Viewer]]: because youtube search sucks now

[[https://planetbanatt.net/savestates/index.html][Savestate Practice Scheduler]]: anki for savestates. Not open to other users yet.

[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLczW29iRM_QcHnhrygCyii6aXM9KwzfaL][Get Strong At Fox]]: Playlist of annotated vods / abridged lesson content I've been putting together, mostly my own content. Some placeholder stuff, some stuff that I don't need to remake (e.g. pipsqueak reaction tech chase video)

*** Not My Stuff

Here's some stuff I didn't built but I use all the time, because it's useful for me.

I'm trying to be less skittish re: posting about the game / competing in general. Here's gonna be some random stuff I needed to write down to remember.
