/Updated: 11/10/2022/

The bulk of the content on this website contains what I consider to be
larger projects of mine, scattered around a number of different topics.
It might be somewhat too much to navigate naively, especially if you 
are not interested in one topic or another. As a result, I maintain
this page, which is a sort of "highlights reel" of what I consider to
be some of my best work across various topics. 

To be slightly more precise, I consider this page to be a representative
sample of what "good work done by Eryk" means, rather than a list of my 
10ish best projects. I figure this makes it more useful than just a [[https://planetbanatt.net/resume.pdf][resume]] 
since most people aren't usually interested in digging around the projects
in a resume anyways. If you want to get to know me, and you ask me to show
you something cool I did, these represent some good things I might show you.

** Target Domain Data induces Negative Transfer in Multi-Source Classification under Category Shift

[[../images/misc/negtransfer.png]]

/(Work yet unpublished)/

My *professional work* primarily revolves around Machine Learning, in
particular deep learning and computer vision tasks. In this work, we
demonstrate that if training data is comprised of multiple domains
split per-class (e.g. some classes have domain A, and other classes
have domain B), then you will notice significantly hindered
performance if one of those domains is the target domain.  This is
because the network learns to take an "intermediate shortcut" which
does not go all the way to the class label (as studied in most
shortcut learning papers), but rather narrows down the choices before
making a decision. We show that this effect persists even when
training with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques,
suggesting it is a setting warranting further study.

** [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/lastdance.pdf][LASTDANCE: Layerwise Activation Similarity to Training Data for Assessing Non-Confirming Events]]

[[../images/misc/trajectoriesresnet.png]]

I am currently enrolled as a part-time Masters Student, and so I do some
more academic-focused work in addition to my more directly work-relevant
tasks. One such work is LASTDANCE, which was a short research paper I
wrote for a class (with a very general "write a research paper" prompt). 
In this work, I develop an anomaly detection method which works in 
scenarios where out-of-distribution points will overlap with in-distribution
points (e.g. monte carlo dropout), making it unsuitable for both feature- 
and label-based methods. The pre-preprint can be found [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/lastdance.pdf][here]], and the code
is available on [[https://github.com/ambisinister/LASTDANCE][github]].

** [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/itsa17.html][Auto-Rating ITG Stamina Charts with Machine Learning]]

[[../images/itsa17/umap_3feat.png]]

I do machine learning in my free time, as well! In this project I used 
some straightforward classical ML techniques, as well as sequence-to-one 
models (RNN, LSTM) in order to automatically rate the difficulty of ITG
Stamina charts, a 4 panel dance rhythm game similar to Dance Dance Revolution.
Code for this project is available on [[https://github.com/ambisinister/itsa17][github]].

** [[https://cogsci.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Thesis2017Banatt.pdf][Input Latency Detection in Expert-Level Gamers]]

[[./images/misc/latency.PNG]]

My *Cognitive Science Senior Thesis at Yale University* was a visuomotor
perception experiment in which I exposed tournament-level SSBM players
(including some top-100 world-ranked players) to precisely timed flashes
of light using an arduino microcontroller in order to test their ability
to blindly determine the presence of input lag compared to a control
group. SSBM tournament matches are all held on CRT Televisions, since
even the fastest LCD monitors necessarily add delay in between your
input and the picture being displayed, effectively slowing down your
reaction time. This has led to certain players to claim they could
notice input lag, even at single-digit-millisecond levels. This
experiment found a large and significant difference in perceptual
ability between tournament-level gamers and a control group, and
suggested the existence of such a perceptual effect to be somewhat
plausible. A slightly abridged version with additional commentary 
can be found [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/lagless.html][here]].

** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ambistats.html][Making Sense of Melee: The Illusion of Objective Ranks and the Real Impact of Everything]]

[[./images/ambistats/winrates_good.png]]

Aside from academic work, I've also done some statistics and data
visualization work within the *Melee Community* under the broad *[[https://meleestats.co/staff/][Melee
Stats]]* umbrella, for which I am Creative Director. The most prominent
of these is /Making Sense of Melee/ - a longform statistics writeup in
which I explore a variety of topics, including flaws in popular
ranking algorithms, the accuracy of seeding at national tournaments (a
topic I was [[http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/20580441/smash-bros-seeding-not-secretive-suspected][interviewed by ESPN esports]] about in 2017), and
probabilities to win against players at differing skill levels. The
post received more than 50,000 hits, reaching [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16255910][#6 on Hacker News]].

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFg_7DcXwBlk&ab_channel%3DMeleeStats][Plup vs Prince Abu - The Weirdest Set Ever Played]]

[[../images/misc/thumbnail.png]]

You will occasionally see my name in longform video content, also,
where I am probably most known for this video about one of my favorite
sets of Super Smash Brothers Melee. The video currently has over
300,000 views on YouTube at the time of writing, and kickstarted [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkemv_CrepoaGxN4sAH5eA][our
channel]], which now has over 25,000 subscribers.

--------------
** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dz8llYT7KGdI&ab_channel%3DMeleeStats][Michael vs Bananas - The Only Reason We Play Melee]]

[[../images/misc/thumbnail_2.png]]

A co-project I did with my good friend [[https://twitter.com/gimmedatwheat?lang%3Den][GimmeDatWheat]]. This particular
set is very famous for the fact that in game 2 neither player played
the game at all. We decided it would be good to make a video about the
construct of community-defined rules in competitive gaming, and about
why people like playing this game at all in the first place.

** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/visualdistance.html][Locating Visual Jokes in Homestuck with Rudimentary Computer Vision]] 

[[./images/homestuck/opening.png]]

I try to cluster together visually similar panels in Andrew Hussie's
webcomic [[https://www.homestuck.com/info-story][Homestuck]] using relatively basic Computer Vision
techniques. Project explores Hamming Distance, Edge Detection,
Perceptual Hashing, K-Means Clustering, Graph Theory, Community
Detection, etc. I end up finding a bunch of panels that are redraws of
each other. A bit long-winded, since it has my entire problem solving
process (failures included) but a pretty cool project of mine.

--------------
** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/personainsmash.html][Predicting Personality with Playstyle in Super Smash Brothers]]
 
[[./images/personality/extraversion_cool.png]]

To get to the bottom of the very common hypothesis that playstyle in
Super Smash Brothers correlates in some meaningful way with
personality, I conducted an informal survey which administered a Big
Five Personality test alongside questions about in-game variables like
playstyle or character. After 1754 participants (!) completed the
survey, I found a modest but significant relationship between some
factors and playstyle question responses.

--------------
** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/hitbox.html][GameCube Controllers in the Era of SmashBox]]

[[./images/smashbox/results2.JPG]]

In which I wired tact switches to precise analog values on a GameCube
controller to emulate
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM-NKXS1m2I][SmashBox]] functionality
without sacrificing analog control or previously built muscle memory.
The video I made for this project proved extremely controversial,
amassing 10,000 views on
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwc0HjXd1k][YouTube]] and over 200
comments on
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/5jur1w/gamecube_controllers_in_the_era_of_smashbox/][Reddit]].

** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/health.html][Optimizing Health with Cronometer]]

[[./images/health/weightloss_1_2017.png]]

Chronicles my 40-lb weight loss near the end of my undergraduate life.
To accomplish this goal (which took only a few months), I read a number
of papers in nutritional science, synthesized a game plan, and measured
every single piece of food I ate for several months to assess the
validity of my approach. I tracked my food intake using
[[https://cronometer.com/][Cronometer]] and adhered to a calorie
counting regime for a short while, and at the end made some charts based
upon my weight over time and the foods I ate. In the end I lost weight
at a constant rate, with the linear regression's R-squared resulting a
staggering 0.98, despite not adhering to any specific macronutrient
balance.

--------------
** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/groundwork_for_projection_algorithm.html][SSBM Bracket Projection Algorithm]]

[[./images/projection/radar.png]]

2015 project in which I use past data to write a simple machine learning
classifier to predict wins and losses at SSBM tournaments, and
outperform basic seed1 > seed2 projections done by smash.gg.

--------------
** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/pingpongzen.html][Zen in the Art of Ping Pong The Animation]]

[[./images/ppta/fly.png]]

I analyze Zen themes in the storylines of cult classic sports anime
[[http://www.crunchyroll.com/ping-pong-the-animation][Ping Pong The
Animation]]. If you're more about my empirical projects, this might not
be quite up your alley. However, if you've seen the show I'm confident
this essay will shed some interesting perspective on it, and if you
haven't seen the show then I'm confident you're missing out on one of
the best pieces of media ever made.

--------------
** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/potbonus.html][Do Pot Bonuses Affect Entrant Numbers at Melee Tournaments?]]

[[./images/potbonus/boxplot_small.png]]

Short writeup on pot bonuses at major tournaments, and their effect on
attendance. I use attendance and prize pool data from 60 large
tournaments between 2015-2017 and use a number of correlational tests
and visualizations in R, ultimately finding no relationship between pot
size and major tournament attendance.

** Violin Plots for KayBeats' [[https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/7rbxeg/assessing_west_coast_bias_on_ssbmrank_and_why_it/]["West Coast Bias in SSBMRank, and Why it Doesn't Exist"]]

KayB is a Melee Stats denizen, and he wrote a post exploring the
supposed "West Coast Bias" in the SSBMRank panel. I collaborated with
him by generating [[https://imgur.com/a/jUfST][Violin Plots]] (boxplots
with kernel density plots overlayed on top of them) of the top 100
ballots, graciously provided by Tafokints.

Some smaller projects and writings of mine are scattered around this
website, since I use this website as a sort of journal / garage /
desk-with-papers-scattered-all-over it. You can find more about me over
at the [[http://planetbanatt.net/about.html][About]] page, you can find
my Resume [[http://planetbanatt.net/resume.pdf][Here]], and you can keep
up with what I'm up to over at the
[[http://planetbanatt.net/links.html][Links]] page.

And, as always, more to come soon!
