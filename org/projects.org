This website has a lot of random things on it, spanning from larger
projects to notedumps on stuff that I'm learning about. As a result,
it might be challenging to understand which of my projects might be
interesting to you. Further confusing is the fact that my work is
generally somewhat interdisciplinary, which means it might be
difficult to identify what projects you would enjoy just based on the
titles.

This page is an attempt to partially solve this: a sort of "start
here" for my overall portfolio of stuff. Rather than being a list of
my best projects, this page is something more like a representative
sample of "good work done by Eryk". If you want to get to know me, and
you ask me to show you something cool I did, these represent some good
things I might show you.

** [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10998][WILT: A Multi-Turn, Memorization-Robust Inductive Logic Benchmark for LLMs]]

[[../images/from_clipboard/20241127_144501.png]]

My professional life revolves around machine learning, particularly in
spots where that could add value to video games. Large language models
(LLMs) are a really promising technology for this, but are mostly
evaluated in a single-turn manner. In comparison, many gaming use
cases that could leverage LLMs would involve multi-turn interaction
with a player, which is a component that is comparatively
understudied. In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on the
Wason 2-4-6 task which measures a model's ability to gather evidence
and infer a hidden rule (e.g. x < y < z). Our work was fortunate
enough to be accepted to the [[https://openreview.net/forum?id=TsAvsEoh0D][NeurIPS 2024 MATH-AI Workshop]]. [[https://x.com/erykbanatt/status/1846406365591253449][Twitter

** [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/deepseek.html][Understanding Modern LLMs via DeepSeek]]

[[../images/from_clipboard/20240614_213621.png]]

I read a lot of papers, and sometimes I'll write literature reviews
synthesizing lots of related ones. In this blogpost, I do a literature
review walking through a large portion of [[https://www.deepseek.com/][DeepSeek]]'s LLM papers, which
details the journey from roughly Llama 2 performance to roughly Llama
3 performance. I made this as an intense survey of Large Language
Modeling literature, intended to bridge the gap between "knowing
transformers" to "understanding modern LLMs".

[[../images/from_clipboard/20241127_150358.png]]

Aside from academic work, I also have made some contributions in the
Super Smash Bros Melee community. While I have some very modest
results as a player (Most notably a lucky run to top 64 at [[https://liquipedia.net/smash/GENESIS/8/Melee/Singles_Bracket][Genesis 8]]),
I am primarily known for my work under the broad *[[https://meleestats.co/staff/][Melee Stats]]*
umbrella, for which I am Creative Director. We've done a variety of
things under this umbrella ([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1K1BWS15YRclWt562XDSKuM-7Nb49bQS][freelance content]] for esports teams, [[https://www.youtube.com/@MeleeStats][video
essays]], and briefly sponsoring [[https://liquipedia.net/smash/Melee_Stats][14 different players in our free agent
showcase]]), our most prominent project is SSBMRank, the yearly top 100
rankings for the SSBM professional scene. This is primarily
[[https://medium.com/@brendanwmalone][GimmeDatWheat]]'s brainchild, but I work as the data lead, where I
crunch all the numbers and gather important data from tournaments.

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8llYT7KGdI][Michael vs Bananas - The Only Reason We Play Melee]]

[[./images/misc/thumbnail_2.png]]

You will occasionally see my name in longform video content. This work
is probably my favorite: it's a video about rules. It covers a famous
set where two professional players didn't move at all, surrounded by a
huge crowd of screaming fans trying to make sense of what was
happening. I like when these sorts of videos have something to say
rather than just describing what happened, so there's a lot of
commentary in this video on top of just recounting events.

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_7DcXwBlk][Plup vs Prince Abu - The Weirdest Set Ever Played]]

[[./images/misc/thumbnail.png]]

Our most highly-viewed video is the first one our team put out: a
video about an obscure set that doesn't make any sense. This video
currently has over 400,000 views on YouTube at the time of writing,
and kickstarted [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkemv_CrepoaGxN4sAH5eA][our channel]], which now has over 25,000 subscribers.

** [[https://cogsci.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Thesis2017Banatt.pdf][Input Latency Detection in Expert-Level Gamers]]

[[./images/misc/latency.PNG]]

As an academic and a melee player, I often get nerdsniped by questions
raised by community members. My cognitive science senior thesis at
Yale University was a visuomotor perception experiment in which I
exposed tournament-level SSBM players (including some top-100
world-ranked players) to precisely timed flashes of light using an
arduino microcontroller in order to test their ability to blindly
determine the presence of input lag compared to a control group. SSBM
tournament matches are all held on CRT Televisions, since even the
fastest LCD monitors necessarily add delay in between your input and
the picture being displayed, effectively slowing down your reaction
time. This has led to certain players to claim they could notice input
lag, even at single-digit-millisecond levels. This experiment found a
large and significant difference in perceptual ability between
tournament-level gamers and a control group, and suggested the
existence of such a perceptual effect to be somewhat plausible. A
slightly abridged version with additional commentary can be found
[[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/lagless.html][here]].

** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/personainsmash.html][Predicting Personality with Playstyle in Super Smash Brothers]]
 
[[./images/personality/extraversion_cool.png]]

Another such question is the very common hypothesis that playstyle in
Super Smash Brothers correlates in some meaningful way with
personality, I conducted an informal survey which administered a Big
Five Personality test alongside questions about in-game variables like
playstyle or character. After 1754 participants (!) completed the
survey, I found a modest but significant relationship between some
factors and playstyle question responses.

** [[https://planetbanatt.net/articles/golems.html][Humanity's Butterfly: Notes on Maimakterion]]

[[../images/from_clipboard/20241127_152109.png]]

I will occasionally write essays about anime and manga, as well, when
things I read intersect with media that I'm interested in. In this
essay, I analyze a short-lived antagonist in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_and_the_Biscuit_Hammer][Lucifer and the Biscuit
Hammer]]/. He is a speaking, shapeshifting golem who learns to speak and
manipulate humans by reading lots of books. I compare this to
modern-day large language models, and point out ways in which this
character differs from traditional kabbalist golem iconography.

** [[http://planetbanatt.net/articles/pingpongzen.html][Zen in the Art of Ping Pong The Animation]]

[[./images/ppta/fly.png]]

Another anime-related essay is this one, where I analyze Zen themes in
the storylines of cult classic sports anime [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/ping-pong-the-animation][Ping Pong The Animation]]. I
often see this show beloved by people who enjoy competing at
tournaments, but some light familiarity with East Asian philosophy can
improve the viewing experience substantially.

Many other projects and writings of mine are scattered around this
website, since I use this space as a sort of journal / garage /
desk-with-papers-scattered-all-over it. You can find more about me
over at the [[http://planetbanatt.net/about.html][About]] page, you can find my Resume [[http://planetbanatt.net/resume.pdf][Here]], and you can keep
up with what I'm up to over at the [[http://planetbanatt.net/links.html][Links]] page.

And, as always, more to come soon!
