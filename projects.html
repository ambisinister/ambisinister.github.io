			<p><i>Updated: 3/5/2018</i></p>

			<p>The bulk of the content on this website contain what I consider to be larger projects of mine, scattered around a number of different topics. It's difficult to organize them well based on a simple list, so I'll periodically update this as a rough list as I accrue more and more projects to add to it.</p>

			<p>Most of my projects are in some way adjacent to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX9hbbA-WP4">Super Smash Brothers Melee</a> community, since involving myself there is what I spend most of my free time on. Aside from finding the game itself super fun, I've found the community to be a great source of inspiration for interesting problems to solve.</p>

			<p>My <strong><a href="https://cogsci.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Thesis2017Banatt.pdf">Cognitive Science Senior Thesis at Yale University</a></strong> - <em>Input Latency Detection in Expert-Level Gamers</em>, was a visuomotor perception experiment in which I exposed tournament-level SSBM players (including some top-100 world-ranked players) to precisely timed flashes of light (using an arduino microcontroller) in order to test their ability to blindly determine the presence of input lag compared to a control group. SSBM tournament matches are all held on CRT Televisions, since even the fastest LCD monitors necessarily add delay in between your input and the picture being displayed (effectively slowing down your reaction time). This has led to certain players to claim they could notice input lag, even at single-digit-millisecond levels. This experiment found a large and significant difference in perceptual ability between tournament-level gamers and a control group, and suggested the existence of such a perceptual effect to be somewhat plausible.</p>

			<p>Aside from academic work, I've also done some statistics and data visualization work within the context of Melee. The most prominent of these  is <strong><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/ambistats.html">Making Sense of Melee: The Illusion of Objective Ranks and the Real Impact of Everything</a></strong> - a longform statistics writeup in which I explore a variety of topics, including flaws in popular ranking algorithms, the accuracy of seeding at national tournaments (a topic I was <a href="http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/20580441/smash-bros-seeding-not-secretive-suspected">interviewed by ESPN esports</a> about in 2017), and probabilities to win against players at differing skill levels. The post received more than 50,000 hits, reaching <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16255910">#6 on Hacker News</a>. Other stats-adjacent projects I've done include <strong><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/groundwork_for_projection_algorithm.html">writing a machine learning classifier to project brackets based on past data</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/potbonus.html">examining the effect of pot bonus size on tournament attendance</a></strong>, and some smaller projects and collaborations like as creating <strong>Violin Plots for KayBeats' <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/7rbxeg/assessing_west_coast_bias_on_ssbmrank_and_why_it/">"West Coast Bias in SSBMRank, and Why it Doesn't Exist"</a></strong>.</p>

			<p>Rounding out the more miscellaneous projects I've done in the Melee community is <strong><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/hitbox.html">GameCube Controllers in the Era of SmashBox</a></strong>, in which I wired tact switches to precise analog values on a GameCube controller to emulate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM-NKXS1m2I">SmashBox</a> functionality without sacrificing analog control or previously built muscle memory - the video I made for this project proved extremely controversial, amassing 10,000 views on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwc0HjXd1k and over 200 comments on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/5jur1w/gamecube_controllers_in_the_era_of_smashbox/">YouTube</a></p>

			<p>Outside of Video Games, I've done a few other interesting projects, most notably <strong><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/health.html">Optimizing Health with Cronometer</a></strong>, which chronicles my 40-lb weight loss near the end of my undergraduate life. To accomplish this goal (which took only a few months), I read a number of papers in nutritional science, synthesized a game plan, and measured every single piece of food I ate for several months to assess the validity of my approach. I tracked my food intake using <a href="https://cronometer.com/">Cronometer</a> and adhered to a calorie counting regime for a short while, and at the end made some charts based upon my weight over time and the foods I ate. In the end I lost weight at a constant rate, with the linear regression's R-squared resulting a staggering 0.98, despite not adhering to any specific macronutrient balance. </p>

			<p>A somewhat off-topic project that I'm very fond of is <strong><a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/pingpongzen.html">Zen in the Art of Ping Pong The Animation</a></strong> in which I analyze Zen themes in the storylines of cult classic sports anime <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/ping-pong-the-animation">Ping Pong The Animation</a>. If you're more about my empirical projects, this might not be quite up your alley. However, if you've seen the show I'm confident this essay will shed some interesting perspective on it, and if you haven't seen the show then I'm confident you're missing out on one of the best pieces of media ever made.</p>

			<p>Some smaller projects and writings of mine are scattered around this website, since I use this website as a sort of journal / garage / desk-with-papers-scattered-all-over it. You can find more about me over at the <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/about.html">About </a> page, you can find my Resume <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/resume.pdf">Here</a>, and you can keep up with what I'm up to over at the <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/links.html">Links</a> page.</p>

			<p>And, as always, more to come soon!</p>
