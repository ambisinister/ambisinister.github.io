			<h3>CS Projects</h3>

			<p><b>Melee Projection Tool</b> - I wrote a basic machine learning tool that predicts which player will win a match given skill level, character used, and past encounters. <a href="./articles/groundwork_for_projection_algorithm.html" target="_blank">Writeup</a> and <a href="./articles/projection_notes.html">misc notes</a>.</p>

			<p><b>Input Latency Detection in Expert-Level Gamers</b> - My Yale undergraduate senior thesis project, where I created a double-blind input latency perception task with Arduino and tested high-level gamers against a control group, and found a significant difference between them. The Thesis can be found <a href="http://cogsci.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Thesis2017Banatt.pdf">here</a> (although the formatting seems to have become a bit wonky), and the final paper is still being worked on.</p>

			<h3>DIY Stuff</h3>

			<p><b>Digital-Analog Conversion Buttons on a Gamecube Controller </b> - I wired a bunch of tact switches onto a Gamecube controller in such a way that they would precisely return analog values. It proved extremely controversial, amassing over 200 comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/5jur1w/gamecube_controllers_in_the_era_of_smashbox/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. Pictures and thoughts <a href="./articles/hitbox.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			<p><b>Adjustable Flickering LED</b> - A really basic <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> project, I made an LED flicker at a precise speed and used it to <a href="./articles/framerate.html" target="_blank">explore the idea of "Framerate"</a> in Human Visual Perception.</p>
