The bulk of the content on this website contains what I consider to be
larger projects of mine, scattered around a number of different topics.
It might be somewhat too much to navigate naively, especially if you 
are not interested in one topic or another. As a result, I maintain
this page, which is a sort of "highlights reel" of what I consider to
be some of my best work across various topics. 
</p>

<p>
To be slightly more precise, I consider this page to be a representative
sample of what "good work done by Eryk" means, rather than a list of my 
10ish best projects. I figure this makes it more useful than just a <a href="https://planetbanatt.net/resume.pdf">resume</a> 
since most people aren't usually interested in digging around the projects
in a resume anyways. If you want to get to know me, and you ask me to show
you something cool I did, these represent some good things I might show you.

My professional work primarily revolves around Machine Learning, where
my background is mostly in computer vision and language modeling. In
this blogpost, I do a literature review walking through the entire
body of <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a>'s LLM papers, which details the journey from roughly
Llama 2 performance to roughly Llama 3 performance. I made this as an
intense survey of Large Language Modeling literature, intended to
bridge the gap between "knowing transformers" to "understanding modern
LLMs".

In this work, we demonstrate that if training data is comprised of
multiple domains split per-class (e.g. some classes have domain A, and
other classes have domain B), then you will notice significantly
hindered performance if one of those domains is the target domain.
This is because the network learns to take an "intermediate shortcut"
which does not go all the way to the class label (as studied in most
shortcut learning papers), but rather narrows down the choices before
making a decision. We show that this effect persists even when
training with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques,
suggesting it is a setting warranting further study.

I am currently enrolled as a part-time Masters Student, and so I do some
more academic-focused work in addition to my more directly work-relevant
tasks. One such work is LASTDANCE, which was a short research paper I
wrote for a class (with a very general "write a research paper" prompt). 
In this work, I develop an anomaly detection method which works in 
scenarios where out-of-distribution points will overlap with in-distribution
points (e.g. monte carlo dropout), making it unsuitable for both feature- 
and label-based methods. The pre-preprint can be found <a href="https://planetbanatt.net/articles/lastdance.pdf">here</a>, and the code
is available on <a href="https://github.com/ambisinister/LASTDANCE">github</a>.

I do machine learning in my free time, as well! In this project I used 
some straightforward classical ML techniques, as well as sequence-to-one 
models (RNN, LSTM) in order to automatically rate the difficulty of ITG
Stamina charts, a 4 panel dance rhythm game similar to Dance Dance Revolution.
Code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/ambisinister/itsa17">github</a>.

My <b>Cognitive Science Senior Thesis at Yale University</b> was a visuomotor
perception experiment in which I exposed tournament-level SSBM players
(including some top-100 world-ranked players) to precisely timed flashes
of light using an arduino microcontroller in order to test their ability
to blindly determine the presence of input lag compared to a control
group. SSBM tournament matches are all held on CRT Televisions, since
even the fastest LCD monitors necessarily add delay in between your
input and the picture being displayed, effectively slowing down your
reaction time. This has led to certain players to claim they could
notice input lag, even at single-digit-millisecond levels. This
experiment found a large and significant difference in perceptual
ability between tournament-level gamers and a control group, and
suggested the existence of such a perceptual effect to be somewhat
plausible. A slightly abridged version with additional commentary 
can be found <a href="http://planetbanatt.net/articles/lagless.html">here</a>.

A co-project I did with my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/gimmedatwheat?lang%3Den">GimmeDatWheat</a>. This particular
set is very famous for the fact that in game 2 neither player played
the game at all. We decided it would be good to make a video about the
construct of community-defined rules in competitive gaming, and about
why people like playing this game at all in the first place.

In this work, we outline a multiplayer variant of the Kelly Coin Flip
Game, which requires a player to guess the opponent's wager and
conserve as many resources as possible. We train a Deep Q-Network to
play this game, and substantially outperform a policy which selects a
random value to wager.  We test this with human players and find that
it plays at about average compared to human players playing for the
first time, suggesting that a competent social agent may have an
advantage at this game compared to a player with no conception of the
other player's intent. Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ambisinister/bracketstamina">here</a>.

I have a passing interest in Memory Sports, and I used to do a lot of
twisty puzzles in my younger days. I never learned to solve a 3x3
blindfolded, so I wanted to build something where I could learn it by
isolating memorization and execution steps. So, I built this super
simple app with Flask. Rather than inputting the moves, you input the
<a href="https://www.speedcubereview.com/blind-solving-algorithms.html">letter pairs from this tutorial</a> which will automatically apply the
correct moves to the virtual cube. Code is available via <a href="https://github.com/ambisinister/blindsolve">github</a>.

To get to the bottom of the very common hypothesis that playstyle in
Super Smash Brothers correlates in some meaningful way with
personality, I conducted an informal survey which administered a Big
Five Personality test alongside questions about in-game variables like
playstyle or character. After 1754 participants (!) completed the
survey, I found a modest but significant relationship between some
factors and playstyle question responses.

Chronicles my 40-lb weight loss near the end of my undergraduate life.
To accomplish this goal (which took only a few months), I read a number
of papers in nutritional science, synthesized a game plan, and measured
every single piece of food I ate for several months to assess the
validity of my approach. I tracked my food intake using
<a href="https://cronometer.com/">Cronometer</a> and adhered to a calorie
counting regime for a short while, and at the end made some charts based
upon my weight over time and the foods I ate. In the end I lost weight
at a constant rate, with the linear regression's R-squared resulting a
staggering 0.98, despite not adhering to any specific macronutrient
balance.
