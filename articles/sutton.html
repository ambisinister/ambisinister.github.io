I am anticipating needing to deeply understand Reinforcement Learning to properly do my job. Everybody says that <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf">this book</a> is the way to do that, so I'm working through it and doing the exercises. I'll be putting the exercises in this document along with some random thoughts I may have. I have done this on here <a href="https://planetbanatt.net/articles/probmods.html">before, with the textbook Probabilistic Models of Cognition</a>, so it will largely be the same as that. I am also roughly following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBKeNJ-JE_eyJHZ7XgBoAyb">the DeepMind x UCL Reinforcement Learning Course (2018)</a> which follows this book. I learn much better from reading and practicing compared to from watching and listening, but it doesn't hurt to attack the problem from all fronts.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org229574c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org229574c">How I Am Reading This Book</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org229574c">
<p>
My primary objective in reading this book is to understand deep reinforcement learning well enough to make meaningful contributions to research, especially where that intersects with both games and broader machine learning (since I currently work at Riot, and think this is the most interesting application of RL<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>).
</p>

<p>
In general, there are two types of learning: let's call them "waow learning" and "ugh learning". In waow learning, you learn a new concept, some good words to say about that concept, and a corpus of other people's thoughts on a topic. In ugh learning, you are running on the treadmill and trying not to die. Since my objective is research, it's of higher relative importance that I do a lot of ugh learning on this topic. I'm not anticipating RL becoming my primary specialty within machine learning, but I need to <i>get it</i> more than I would to read through an RL paper and nod sagely when I see familiar terms. I do my best work when I get really <i>opinionated</i> about a topic, and I can't reliably do that without chaining myself to the treadmill.
</p>

<p>
So, I'll be doing all of the exercises in this textbook, barring the ones which are starred or are inside of starred sections. The exception here is chapter 11, which I will be doing since I'm anticipating it being relevant to what I'm aiming to actually do with it. The majority of these are near the beginning of the book (chapter 3 has almost 30 exercises, most chapters after have about 10, part III has one exercise total). I'm going to make a good faith effort to actually get through the whole book, including these less exercise-heavy chapters / ones not covered in the DeepMind course. We will see how well I stick to it, but I have some optimism. Likewise, at the end I'll be making cloze deletion flashcards of the convenient summary sections at the end of every chapter.
</p>

<p>
<b>Please Note: I give no guarantee of correctness for my solutions to these exercises.</b> This is not an answer key, it's my attempt at fighting through a textbook to learn a new topic<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. Likewise, these answers aren't of the quality I would submit as a homework assignment, they're just having passed the threshold where I believe it is clear to myself that I understand the solution<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. I'll be checking my answers to the exercises with LLMs as I work through the book, which should be noted in the little <i>status</i> line at the start of each subsection.
</p>

<p>
In addition, this book is actually pretty surface level on deep RL specifically &#x2013; this book just represents the background necessary for understanding the RL part. I'm hopeful that I already understand the deep part, but it's helpful for me to have a plan of attack for after I complete the book. In particular, I'm planning on reading through the code for important algorithms in <a href="https://docs.cleanrl.dev/">CleanRL</a>, along some important relevant papers. This will probably be it's own post, but I'll link it here once I get to that point.

<h2 id="orgaea68fd">What I Think About The Book</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaea68fd">
<p>
So far I have a few thoughts about this book. In general I consider myself relatively not math-inclined<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>; my strengths mostly lie in my ability to throw borderline obsessive amounts of effort at projects. But I do have a fair bit of good experience in machine learning, programming, artificial intelligence, all that sort of stuff. The jury is probably out on whether I was better-suited for this book compared to a plucky engineering undergraduate, but I figured it should all be within my grasp.
</p>

<p>
I found myself able to navigate the exercises in this book with great difficulty. They were very challenging to me, and I expected my background to be of much greater help than it ended up being. I was forced to acknowledge that maybe, just a little bit, I was letting my eyes glaze over a little bit when I read through dense notation in papers. The notation in RL is very intense<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>, and this book does not pull punches. It was all fairly doable, but I was grateful that I worked through it after we invented LLMs / after I landed somewhere with bright colleagues who already know this topic.
</p>

<p>
I think the structure of the book is very strong. Almost all the ideas that are introduced feel like very natural extensions of previously introduced topics, and you arrive at a nice unifying framework for why the important techniques make the decisions that they make. This is pretty nice compared to just reading papers about it.
</p>

<p>
Overall I think that it makes sense to consider this the canonical book on reinforcement learning. I think it could be more gentle, but it would probably be twice the length. I think it could have more neural networks / deep RL in it, but then the purpose of the book would probably get too muddled, and it runs the risk of more quickly growing dated. This book is probably your best bet if you have access to some sort of teacher, and definitely seems like more of a foundation-building text about the field in general.
</p>

<p>
Overall good.

<h4 id="org7215813">Exercise 1.1: Self-Play</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7215813">
<p>
Suppose, instead of playing against a random opponent, the
reinforcement learning algorithm described above played against itself, with both sides
learning. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a different policy
for selecting moves?
</p>

I already know self-play already works for achieving high skill in RL tasks (see: alphago) but I do think it's possible for larger environments that policies learned through self-play to tunnel into behaviors which do not fully explore a very complex environment. I remember seeing some papers exploiting this by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00241">learning adversarial policies</a> that win by creating out-of-distribution states. But for something simple like tic-tac-toe I doubt it would cause huge problems, in the limit both will explore the space completely.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5c9fe40">
<p>
Many tic-tac-toe positions appear different but are really
the same because of symmetries. How might we amend the learning process described
above to take advantage of this? In what ways would this change improve the learning
process? Now think again. Suppose the opponent did not take advantage of symmetries.
In that case, should we? Is it true, then, that symmetrically equivalent positions should
necessarily have the same value?
</p>

<p>
We could take advantage of this via data augmentation in training, applying all the different rotations and mirrors to the game board and having 8 training examples instead of 1 per episode. This would make us equally strong from all angles, since we will have an equal balance of the different versions of the same positions. Taking advantage of the symmetries shouldn't have any different effects whether or not our opponent uses them or not &#x2013; they're literally identical states, and should have identical value functions as a result. One thing which may break this is if we learn that our opponent is worse at one particular rotation of the game board, and seeking to exploit that. If we do augmentation this way, we won't be able to learn that sort of thing, since we will be artificially improving their performance in those spots, but in exchange we get more training examples and better balance subject to symmetry.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7d3011a">
<p>
Suppose the reinforcement learning player was greedy, that is,
it always played the move that brought it to the position that it rated the best. Might it
learn to play better, or worse, than a nongreedy player? What problems might occur?
</p>

<p>
If the player was greedy and never explored, that could lead to lots of problems where states get assigned incorrect value estimations. For example, if you have an action which causes +1 reward 90% of the time and -1 reward 10% of the time, and you happen to get -1 reward the first time you take that option, your estimation for that action is likely to be irrecoverably wrong. The purpose of non-greedy decisions is to make sure that your "rating the best" is actually accurate, since over time you'll get a better picture of more types of states that way.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgebc8d95">
<p>
Suppose learning updates occurred after all
moves, including exploratory moves. If the step-size parameter is appropriately reduced
over time (but not the tendency to explore), then the state values would converge to
a different set of probabilities. What (conceptually) are the two sets of probabilities
computed when we do, and when we do not, learn from exploratory moves? Assuming
that we do continue to make exploratory moves, which set of probabilities might be better
to learn? Which would result in more wins?
</p>

<p>
Consider a case where you have a state which is next to the goal state, and also next to a state which kills you. In the greedy case, you would love to be in this state, because then you can go to the goal state, and you'll get very high reward. But in the exploration-enabled case, this state is kind of risky because there's a change you'll decide to explore in this state, land in the death state, and recieve a big negative reward. If you learn after exploratory moves, you're learning the value of the state including that probability of randomly dying, whereas otherwise you aren't. If you want to keep doing this exploration, you might be better off using these probabilities, since avoiding death is pretty important, but if you plan on turning those moves off then there's no need to avoid this hypothetical state.

In the long run. \eps = 0.01 will perform best. \eps = 0.1 learns the
optimal action the fastest, but is bottlenecked by the fact that it
must select a random action 10% of the time, meaning it gets optimal
reward 91% of the time. In comparison, once \eps = 0.01 learns the

The results shown in Figure 2.3 should be quite reliable
because they are averages over 2000 individual, randomly chosen 10-armed bandit tasks.
Why, then, are there oscillations and spikes in the early part of the curve for the optimistic
method? In other words, what might make this method perform particularly better or
worse, on average, on particular early steps? ⇤
</p>

<p>
If the rewards are optimistic, it's very likely that you will pull all the levers once after only a few turns, since you'll be disappointed each time. You should then get a good picture of the best one very quickly, which means you should pick the best option very often very early on. However, you run into a problem &#x2013; greedily picking that option will make your estimate of that state worse, so by picking it you temporarily make it less likely to be selected again. This will continue until the estimates are accurate enough for selecting the best option to not make the estimate worse than the estimates for the other options.

on nonstationary problems. Is it possible to avoid the bias of constant step sizes while
retaining their advantages on nonstationary problems? One way is to use a step size of

In Figure 2.4 the UCB algorithm shows a distinct spike

satisfactory it must explain both why the reward increases on the 11th step and why it
decreases on the subsequent steps. Hint: If c = 1, then the spike is less prominent. ⇤
</p>

<p>
If you have 10 bandits after only a few trials, the UCB term will likely dominate for untested bandits, so it will test all the bandits once each in the first ten trials. On the 11th trial, all of the UCB terms will be equal, so it's very likely to pull the bandit which returned the highest value, which is most often the optimal one. However, once you do that, you reduce the UCB term for that bandit, which means that you'll start wanting to pull the other bandits again. This will repeat until the UCB term goes to ~0 after many trials. When c=1, this term is less dominating, so it becomes more possible to select two bandits twice in the first 10 trials, which would diffuse this spike to adjacent timesteps.

the true values of actions 1 and 2 are respectively 10 and 20 with probability 0.5 (case
A), and 90 and 80 with probability 0.5 (case B). If you are not able to tell which case

you behave to achieve it? Now suppose that on each step you are told whether you are

Devise three example tasks of your own that fit into the MDP framework,
identifying for each its states, actions, and rewards. Make the three examples as different
from each other as possible. The framework is abstract and flexible and can be applied in
many different ways. Stretch its limits in some way in at least one of your examples. ⇤
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Chess can be framed as an MDP, where each state is a board position, each action is the legal moves you can perform in that position, and each reward is the relative value of the position (or just 1 for goal state and -1 for loss state)</li>

<li>Flirting with someone can be framed as an MDP, where each state is the current point in a conversation, each action is what you can say at that point, and the reward is how much you observe they're into what you're saying (can be negative, for example if you start talking about how flirting is a Markov Decision Process)</li>

<li>Doing the exercises in Sutton and Barto can be framed as an MDP. Each state is your current location in the textbook, each action is your letter by letter solving of the problem (e.g. you write answers one letter at a time), and each reward is the feedback from a teacher or LLM about how well you solved an exercise.</li>

Is the MDP framework adequate to usefully represent all goal-directed
learning tasks? Can you think of any clear exceptions? ⇤
</p>

<p>
Maybe not usefully; a big component of this is that MDPs have the markov property (where the past sequence of events is priced into the current state, and two identical "states" which would have different local behaviors based on the path required to reach them would get represented as different states). It's possible there are MDPs it's hard to represent the state as being independent of / inclusive of the entire history prior (i.e. it is possible, but the state space is so large that the dynamics can't be learned well). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaStar_(software)">Starcraft</a> might be one of these? They struggled to reach superhuman play under human constraints and had to rely on imitation learning due to the overly large state space, due to the "exploration problem".

Consider the problem of driving. You could define the actions in terms of
the accelerator, steering wheel, and brake, that is, where your body meets the machine.
Or you could define them farther out—say, where the rubber meets the road, considering
your actions to be tire torques. Or you could define them farther in—say, where your
brain meets your body, the actions being muscle twitches to control your limbs. Or you
could go to a really high level and say that your actions are your choices of where to drive.
What is the right level, the right place to draw the line between agent and environment?
On what basis is one location of the line to be preferred over another? Is there any
fundamental reason for preferring one location over another, or is it a free choice? ⇤
</p>

<p>
I imagine your framing matters a lot here. If you want to build a system which outperforms humans at driving, you'll likely be interested in defining it at the machine level (unless you were building a humanoid robot which drives) because in that case you're able to directly actuate the pedals and stuff. If you're building a gps navigation service which arrives at a location while avoiding the most traffic, you don't actually care about the machine at all. If you're drunk at a bar, you hopefully would carefully consider that your body's condition introduces an additional level of uncertainty to your observations and actions, even though your car in the parking lot didn't change at all. It's not so much that it's a free choice, rather that it depends on the type of problem you are attempting to solve with your agent.

<p>
The equations in Section 3.1 are for the continuing case and need to be
modified (very slightly) to apply to episodic tasks. Show that you know the modifications
needed by giving the modified version of (3.3).
</p>

<p>
continuing case:
</p>

<p>
\(\sum_{s' \in S} \sum_{r \in R} p(s', r | s, a) = 1 \text{ for all } s \in S, a \in A(s)\)
</p>

<p>
episodic case:
</p>

<p>
\(\sum_{s' \in S \cup T} \sum_{r \in R} p(s', r | s, a) = 1 \text{ for all } s \in S, a \in A(s) \text{ where T is the set of terminal states }\)
</p>

<p>
Exercise 3.6 Suppose you treated pole-balancing as an episodic task but also used
discounting, with all rewards zero except for -1 upon failure. What then would the
return be at each time? How does this return differ from that in the discounted, continuing
formulation of this task? ⇤
</p>

<p>
\(G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{T} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\)
</p>

<p>
Since R is always 0 except at the terminal state, we can just write this simply as
</p>

<p>
\(G_t = -\gamma^T\)
</p>

<p>
This differs from the discounted, continuing formulation of this task because the reward in the continuous case the model will get negative reward every time it's not balancing, but if it falls it can right itself again to resume having no penalty. In the episodic case, it will just reset so that you start again, and you're directly maximizing the time to first failure rather than the minimum number of failures as late as possible.

Imagine that you are designing a robot to run a maze. You decide to give it a
reward of +1 for escaping from the maze and a reward of zero at all other times. The task
seems to break down naturally into episodes—the successive runs through the maze—so
you decide to treat it as an episodic task, where the goal is to maximize expected total
reward (3.7). After running the learning agent for a while, you find that it is showing
no improvement in escaping from the maze. What is going wrong? Have you effectively
communicated to the agent what you want it to achieve? ⇤
</p>

<p>
If you do this, the agent will try to get out of the maze eventually, with no rush at all for how long that takes. As a result, with a long enough time horizon, taking enough random actions will eventually reach the terminal state, and all trials will have the same reward (+1). You aren't making it learn the maze, you're just asking it to exist until the terminal state is reached, and then rewarding it. What you would prefer is punishing -1 for every time step, so that the agent is rewarded for getting out faster, which will incentivize it to actually learn to escape the maze.

Consider the continuing MDP shown to the
right. The only decision to be made is that in the top state,
where two actions are available, left and right. The numbers
show the rewards that are received deterministically after
each action. There are exactly two deterministic policies,
⇡left and ⇡right. What policy is optimal if &gamma; = 0? If &gamma; = 0.9?
If &gamma; = 0.5? ⇤
</p>

<p>
if &gamma; is zero, future rewards will be ignored, and you'll prefer &pi;<sub>left</sub> which provides immediate reward. With &gamma; = 0.9, you'll prefer &pi;<sub>right</sub> since you'll care a lot about the resulting +2 after the first state. At &gamma; = 0.5, both policies are equivalent, since left is \(1 + 0.5(0) + 0.25 R_{t+3}\) and right is \(0 + 0.5(2) + 0.25 R_{t+3}\).

The policy iteration algorithm on page 80 has a subtle bug in that it may
never terminate if the policy continually switches between two or more policies that are
equally good. This is okay for pedagogy, but not for actual use. Modify the pseudocode
so that convergence is guaranteed. ⇤
</p>

<p>
The only way it's possible to repeatedly switch between policies that are equally good but not the same are if the resulting rewards from both states are the same. In this code we save the existing action &pi;(s) and then assign the action in that state to the argmax of the new values. All we have to do to avoid this bug is additionally store old-value which is just V(old-action), and then mark policy-stable as false if V(&pi;(s)) != V(old-action). We don't care if the action changes, we care if the policy improves.

in policy evaluation you can substitute these lines

\(v \leftarrow V(s)\)

<p>
and it should be good from there (plus changing initialization and updating policy with max q instead of v, of course). The important part is that since you're not keeping track of V(s), you have to expand it out in terms of Q, which involves the all the possible actions over the next state.

Write a program for policy iteration and re-solve Jack’s car
rental problem with the following changes. One of Jack’s employees at the first location
rides a bus home each night and lives near the second location. She is happy to shuttle
one car to the second location for free. Each additional car still costs $2, as do all cars
moved in the other direction. In addition, Jack has limited parking space at each location.
If more than 10 cars are kept overnight at a location (after any moving of cars), then an
additional cost of $4 must be incurred to use a second parking lot (independent of how
many cars are kept there). These sorts of nonlinearities and arbitrary dynamics often

Why does the optimal

If you imagine the all flip at 50 being 0.4 probability to win, betting 1 at 51 means you are adding the probability of getting 50 more points starting with 1 to the fixed probability of 0.4, making it strictly better.

Honestly, no. The value and policy both do converge, given enough timesteps, but the form they take is pretty unusual. I wonder if there are multiple optimal actions for each state, and the wild behavior of the policy is not preferring one type of state to the other? The code is pretty simple so I imagine this has to do with the problem statement, but I'm definitely left with more questions than answers.

<p>
It jumps up because those are the ones you stick and often win. It drops off on the left because if the dealer has a usable ace they're more likely to win also.

In learning curves such as those shown in Figure 5.3 error generally decreases
with training, as indeed happened for the ordinary importance-sampling method. But for

</p>

<p>
Weighted importance sampling starts from a biased estimation and updates a ratio towards the other policy, compared to ordinary importance sampling which monotonically increases the denominator. With OIS, the variance is high that improving with more samples is much larger than the effect of having only a few samples, but with WIS, you'll likely need a few samples before it starts heading in the right direction, which could lead to a temporary increase in error.

In the boxed algorithm for off-policy MC control, you may have been

<p>
This is because we are using W to incrementally update the importance sampling ratio, and we modify the ratio each Q assignment rather than calculating it from scratch every time.

Specifically, we can observe that after A<sub>t</sub> has been selected by &pi;, \(\pi(A_t|S_t) = 1\), which matches what we have above. W in this case is just repeatedly multiplying this together, which makes it the same as a product of importance sampling ratios.

Consider driving a race car around a turn
like those shown in Figure 5.5. You want to go as fast as possible, but not so fast as
to run o↵ the track. In our simplified racetrack, the car is at one of a discrete set of
grid positions, the cells in the diagram. The velocity is also discrete, a number of grid
cells moved horizontally and vertically per time step. The actions are increments to the
velocity components. Each may be changed by +1, 1, or 0 in each step, for a total of
nine (3 ⇥ 3) actions. Both velocity components are restricted to be nonnegative and less
than 5, and they cannot both be zero except at the starting line. Each episode begins
in one of the randomly selected start states with both velocity components zero and
ends when the car crosses the finish line. The rewards are 1 for each step until the car
crosses the finish line. If the car hits the track boundary, it is moved back to a random
position on the starting line, both velocity components are reduced to zero, and the
episode continues. Before updating the car’s location at each time step, check to see if
the projected path of the car intersects the track boundary. If it intersects the finish line,
the episode ends; if it intersects anywhere else, the car is considered to have hit the track
boundary and is sent back to the starting line. To make the task more challenging, with
probability 0.1 at each time step the velocity increments are both zero, independently of
the intended increments. Apply a Monte Carlo control method to this task to compute
the optimal policy from each starting state. Exhibit several trajectories following the
optimal policy (but turn the noise off for these trajectories). ⇤

This is an exercise to help develop your intuition about why TD methods
are often more ecient than Monte Carlo methods. Consider the driving home example
and how it is addressed by TD and Monte Carlo methods. Can you imagine a scenario
in which a TD update would be better on average than a Monte Carlo update? Give
an example scenario—a description of past experience and a current state—in which
you would expect the TD update to be better. Here’s a hint: Suppose you have lots
of experience driving home from work. Then you move to a new building and a new
parking lot (but you still enter the highway at the same place). Now you are starting
to learn predictions for the new building. Can you see why TD updates are likely to be
much better, at least initially, in this case? Might the same sort of thing happen in the
original scenario?
</p>

<p>
In the new case where you have a new final destination, an important note is that your initial path home from work is the same in both cases (getting on and off the highway in the same spots). As a result, you already know how long those time steps take, and the likely difference in total time between those states is likely to be the exact same. In TD learning, the important thing is that your early states stay similar relative to each other, and that you figure out your new trailing states. In MC methods, you need to completely update all the states to predict the final time, which resets everything since every state directly learns the resulting dynamics of everything after it.
</p>

<p>
In the original scenario, this might happen too. If a road is closed and one leg is now abnormally slow, the rest of the state value estimates might still be pretty accurate relative to each other, compared to MC methods which do not handle this type of case well.

From the results shown in the left graph of the random walk example it
appears that the first episode results in a change in only V(A). What does this tell you
about what happened on the first episode? Why was only the estimate for this one state
changed? By exactly how much was it changed?
</p>

<p>
It makes sense that only one state updated. The only two states that can update in TD learning with equal initialization like this are the ones next to the terminal states. The middle ones all update to \(V(S_t) + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)]\) which in this case is V(S<sub>t</sub>) + 0 + (1 * 0.5) - 0.5 which is just V(S<sub>t</sub>). The right state can update upwards, but only if the episode actually visits that state (and it can only go to one of the states. In our case here, V(A) will update to 0.5 + 0.1[0 + 1*0 - 0.5] which equals 0.45, which checks out in the diagram.

about which algorithm is better would be affected if a wider range of &alpha; values were used?
Is there a different, fixed value of &alpha; at which either algorithm would have performed
significantly better than shown? Why or why not? 
</p>

<p>
For this problem it makes sense that TD methods are more sample efficient. MC methods rely heavily upon the fact that you can arrive at the value of the state after sampling lots of episode returns and averaging them for each state. TD methods will instead increment based on the estimates of surrounding states, which makes it more like a combination of DP methods and MC methods. I can imagine that there are very unwise alpha values for which TD methods may fail to converge, though, for example if &alpha; = 1, V(A) in our last example would be assigned a new value of 0, which seems bad. In this case, MC methods would still be making updates based on the total returns, while TD methods only get to consider adjacent states, which might make them more likely to diverge instead of converge.

In Example 6.2 we stated that the true values for the random walk example

these could have been computed. Which would you guess we actually used? Why?

<p>
I probably would have used value iteration, where we can repeatedly improve the estimates until they converged. You could also use monte carlo methods starting from each state and averaging the return, which would also be pretty easy and would arrive at these values in the limit.

Why is Q-learning considered an <i>off-policy</i> control method?
</p>

<p>
Q-learning is considered an off-policy control method because it directly approximates the optimal action-value function but doesn't use that function to actually select actions to perform this calculation. This makes it different from Sarsa, which will use the Q value of the action actually taken from S<sub>t+1</sub>, compared to Q learning which performs the update using the maximum Q value available from S<sub>t+1</sub> (even if it decides to do something else)

Suppose action selection is greedy. Is Q-learning then exactly the same
algorithm as Sarsa? Will they make exactly the same action selections and weight

</p>

<p>
If action selection is greedy, then \(max_a Q(S_{t+1}, a) = Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})\), meaning Sarsa and Q-learning are the same. The difference here is that if you want to add an exploratory policy, Sarsa would use that policy to update, but Q-learning would use the same greedy action selection regardless of what action is actually taken. Note: this also assumes that ties are broken the same way. If they differ then obviously they are no longer the same, but I'm assuming from the way the question is asked that this means "if the actions are always the same"

Describe how the task of Jack’s Car Rental (Example 4.2) could be
reformulated in terms of afterstates. Why, in terms of this specific task, would such a
reformulation be likely to speed convergence?
</p>

<p>
In Jack's Car Rental, your "move" is how many cars you move from location A to location B (which can be negative, if you want to move cars from B to A). The "opponent move" is how many cars get added or subtracted from each location (i.e. from rentals and returns).
</p>

<p>
In this situation, you will often arrive at the same number of cars in both locations even if all of these numbers vary a lot (i.e. I have 0 and 3, I move -1 to get 1 and 2, location A has 1 return, location B has 1 rental, leading to 2 and 1. This is the same, for example, as starting with 2 and 1, doing 0 moves, and having 3 rentals and 3 returns in each situation). The number of possible paths spirals out to a dramatically high number (since many values can vary) but the actual resulting states is limited to just that 20x20 box, so framing it as the resulting number before doing the update is much more likely to lead to fast convergence since you'll be able to cross-learn from different situations.

In Chapter 6 we noted that the Monte Carlo error can be written as the
sum of TD errors (6.6) if the value estimates don’t change from step to step. Show that
the n-step error used in (7.2) can also be written as a sum of TD errors (again if the
value estimates don’t change) generalizing the earlier result.
</p>

<p>
Recall the TD Error
</p>

<p>
\(\delta_t \doteq R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\)
</p>

<p>
The n-step error here is the bracketed part of 7.2:
</p>

<p>
\(V_{t+n}(S_t) \doteq V_{t+n-1}(S_t) + \alpha [G_{t:t+n} - V_{t+n-1}(S_t)]\)
</p>

<p>
Since the values won't change we can just write it as V from now on.
</p>

<p>
The n-step return is:
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n})\)
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n}) - V(S_t)\)
</p>

<p>
For this last step, we can add and subtract the same values like so:
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n}) + \gamma^{n-1} V(S_{t+n-1}) - \gamma^{n-1} V(S_{t+n-1}) + ... - V(S_t)\)
</p>

<p>
Rearranging we get
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) + R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 V(S_{t+2}) - \gamma V(S_{t+1}) + ... + R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n}) - \gamma^{n-1} V(S_{t+n-1})\)
</p>

<p>
Which is
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = \delta_t + \gamma \delta_{t+1} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} \delta_{t+n-1}\)
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = \sum_{k=t}^{t+n-1} \gamma^{k-1} \delta_k\)

With an n-step method, the value estimates do change from step to
step, so an algorithm that used the sum of TD errors (see previous
exercise) in place of the error in (7.2) would actually be a slightly
different algorithm. Would it be a better algorithm or a worse one?
Devise and program a small experiment to answer this question
empirically.
</p>

<p>
I am stupid and I tried to do this with n-step sarsa, which doesn't use value estimates at all. I don't really feel like going back and implementing n-step TD and then making this changes, but intuitively I feel like using the TD errors would provide a more biased estimate towards the current values, which might be better in situations where the values have higher variance or change over time. It's probably better or worse depending on the problem.
</p>

<p>
I may revisit this later but I at least still got to do some programming in this chapter so we will call it completed even though it's wrong.

Why do you think a larger random walk task (19 states instead of 5) was
used in the examples of this chapter? Would a smaller walk have shifted the advantage
to a different value of n? How about the change in left-side outcome from 0 to -1 made
in the larger walk? Do you think that made any difference in the best value of n?
</p>

<p>
With a shorter random walk task, it takes fewer n for your n-step method to pretty much be a MC method (barring the very unlikely extremes, which are truncated). It seems unlikely that you'd get as interesting separation in this experiment compared to the version with the longer walk.
</p>

<p>
The left-side value being -1 means that the range of values is twice as large, which means that the variance of the cumulative returns. With higher variance, larger values of n are likely to be better.

The nonplanning method looks particularly poor in Figure 8.3 because it is
a one-step method; a method using multi-step bootstrapping would do better. Do you
think one of the multi-step bootstrapping methods from Chapter 7 could do as well as
the Dyna method? Explain why or why not.
</p>

<p>
The methods do slightly different things. The dyna method specifically is useful in these cases where the environment doesn't change very much and is deterministic, so you can just replay old experience and continually get useful updates without actually observing them. The multi-step bootstrapping methods are more about propagating information through more states per real update, which might more quickly arrive at a policy which arrives at the goal state from the start state using a completely greedy policy, but would still take longer to correct suboptimal path turns compared to something like dyna.

Why did the Dyna agent with exploration bonus, Dyna-Q+, perform

Encouraging it to explore means it's more likely to correct errors in the model, which is important because otherwise dyna will fill the Q table with values based on unlikely events it happened to observe.

Careful inspection of Figure 8.5 reveals that the difference between Dyna-Q+

When the models are correct, encouraging it to do extra exploration provides minimal value over doing more exploitation, which is done in Dyna-Q more than Dyna-Q+. Once exploration becomes more important, the advantage of Dyna-Q+ widens substantially, but there's a cost associated with that, it's not just always better.

In general this seems much slower to learn compared to normal, since it adds a substantial premium to exploring new states. I get the sense that this is building a better Q table compared to the normal way, where the Q values more accurate reflect the actual expected returns (by virtue of not having the values polluted by the exploration bonus), at the cost of slower convergence for the best policy resulting from it.

How might the tabular Dyna-Q algorithm shown on page 164 be modified
to handle stochastic environments? How might this modification perform poorly on
changing environments such as considered in this section? How could the algorithm be
modified to handle stochastic environments and changing environments?
</p>

<p>
Replace (e) with a table of state transitions and rewards, and instead of just taking from it you sample from it instead. This might perform poorly because you'll take a long time to notice changes in the environment, since you'll just have to keep updating until the new change dwarfs the old one, so to make it handle changing environments you could keep a sort of running table of the most recent \(k\) visits to that state, instead of every one, which will naturally kill off information from older visits.

Some of the graphs in Figure 8.8 seem to be scalloped in their early portions,
particularly the upper graph for b = 1 and the uniform distribution. Why do you think
this is? What aspects of the data shown support your hypothesis?
</p>

<p>
A very noteworthy thing about the scalloping in the graphs is that they all happen at the same time for each plot, regardless of whether it's using on-policy or uniform. If we assume that the on-policy and uniform cases make the same number of model updates per real update, it's probably at those cases where the model completes an episode and resets back to the start state. Since both models have done a number of real updates at the beginning of the MDP, it is likely that this update is going to be a pretty moderate change compared to later values which are likely to be more inaccurate (and thus change the overall estimate a lot more).

<p>
Linear function approximation estimates \(\hat{v}\) using the following form:

It takes this form because in linear function approximation, |w| &lt;&lt; |S|. If we relax this assumption such that |w| = |S|, we can have |S| parameters, each with a weight in |w| representing that parameter's estimated v value. The features \(x\), as a result, would just be a one-hot vector of size |S| which is 0 in all states except for the single parameter corresponding to that state's estimated value. This makes linear function approximation reduce to keeping estimated v values for each state, as was done in every tabular method in part I.

I'm a bit confused by this question &#x2013; if you have n features and k dimensions, then this product which includes 0 (i.e. not including the feature) will have (n+1)<sup>k</sup> features.

Suppose we believe that one of two state dimensions is more likely to have

</p>

<p>
It would be more advantageous to use tiling which (comparatively) ignores the second dimension in favor of providing higher granularity along the first dimension. For example, in the horizontal stripes tiling, we care a lot about the vertical axis, but don't differentiate between two examples which have the same vertical coordinate. We could use a much coarser second tiling for the horizontal axis, since we know ahead of time that it if less likely to vary, and we will get superior generalization compared to the case where we consider each axis equally.

Suppose you are using tile coding to transform a seven-dimensional continuous
state space into binary feature vectors to estimate a state value function vˆ(s,w) ⇡ v⇡(s).
You believe that the dimensions do not interact strongly, so you decide to use eight tilings
of each dimension separately (stripe tilings), for 7 x 8 = 56 tilings. In addition, in case
there are some pairwise interactions between the dimensions, you also take all \({7 \choose 2}\) = 21
pairs of dimensions and tile each pair conjunctively with rectangular tiles. You make
two tilings for each pair of dimensions, making a grand total of 21 x 2 + 56 = 98 tilings.
Given these feature vectors, you suspect that you still have to average out some noise,
so you decide that you want learning to be gradual, taking about 10 presentations with
the same feature vector before learning nears its asymptote. What step-size parameter &alpha;
should you use? Why?
</p>

<p>
per 9.19 you should use \(\alpha \doteq (10 \mathbb{E}[x^T x])^{-1}\)

<p>
In our case, you have 98 tilings. Specifically, you have eight different stripe tilings for each dimension, where for each dimension 1 will be active and the rest will be inactive. Likewise, for the pairwise ones, you have two different pairwise tilings for each dimension pair, for each 1 will be active and the rest will be inactive. This is important because no matter what vector x you take, you should have the same number of 1s and 0s, which means the dot product \(x^T x\) is a constant (i.e. 98). Since it's a constant, it's expectation is a constant, so we arrive at just \(\alpha \doteq \frac{1}{980}\)

One of the simplest artificial neural networks consists of a single semi-linear
unit with a logistic nonlinearity. The need to handle approximate value functions of this
form is common in games that end with either a win or a loss, in which case the value of

*Exercise 9.8 Arguably, the squared error used to derive (9.7) is inappropriate for the
case treated in the preceding exercise, and the right error measure is the cross-entropy
loss (which you can find on Wikipedia). Repeat the derivation in Section 9.3, using the

Why do the results shown in Figure 10.4 have higher standard errors at large n than at small n?
</p>

<p>
If the n is too large, the time horizon for updating is too long. As a result, the greater distance between the current state and the state n steps ago creates a larger degree of uncertainty between the two states, which in turn increases the standard error.

Suppose there is an MDP that under any policy produces the deterministic
sequence of rewards +1, 0, +1, 0, +1, 0,&#x2026; going on forever. Technically, this violates
ergodicity; there is no stationary limiting distribution µ⇡ and the limit (10.7) does not
exist. Nevertheless, the average reward (10.6) is well defined. What is it?
</p>

<p>
Now consider two states in this MDP. From A, the reward sequence is exactly as described above,
starting with a +1, whereas, from B, the reward sequence starts with a 0 and then
continues with +1, 0, +1, 0,&#x2026;. We would like to compute the differential values of A and
B. Unfortunately, the differential return (10.9) is not well defined when starting from
these states as the implicit limit does not exist. To repair this, one could alternatively
define the differential value of a state as
</p>

<p>
\(v_\pi(s) \doteq lim_{\gamma \rightarrow 1} lim_{h \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{t=0}^{h}\gamma^t (\mathbb{E}_\pi[R_{t+1}|S_0=s] - r(\pi))\)

<p>
&#x2013;

As a result the calculations for these for A are:
</p>

<p>
\((1 - 0.5) + \gamma(0 - 0.5) + \gamma^2(1 - 0.5) + etc\)
</p>

<p>
\(v(A) = 0.5 - \gamma 0.5 + \gamma^2 0.5 + etc\)

<p>
\(v(A) = 0.5(1 - \gamma + gamma^2 + etc)\)
</p>

<p>
\(v(A) = 0.5(1 / (1 + \gamma))\)

and as lim &gamma; &rarr; 1, A = 0.25

The pseudocode in the box on page 251 updates R¯t using &delta;<sub>t</sub> as an error
rather than simply Rt+1 - R¯t. Both errors work, but using &delta;<sub>t</sub> is better. To see why,
consider the ring MRP of three states from Exercise 10.6. The estimate of the average
reward should tend towards its true value of 1/3 . Suppose it was already there and was
held stuck there. What would the sequence of Rt+1 - R¯t errors be? What would the
sequence of &delta;<sub>t</sub> errors be (using Equation 10.10)? Which error sequence would produce
a more stable estimate of the average reward if the estimate were allowed to change in
response to the errors? Why?
</p>

<p>
The sequence of R<sub>t+1</sub> - \bar{R}<sub>t</sub> would be
</p>

<p>
2/3, -1/3, -1/3, 2/3, -1/3, -1/3, 2/3, -1/3, -1/3
</p>

<p>
We need the V values of each state to do the next part, so we solve using the differential values
</p>

<p>
V(A) = 2/3 + V(B)
</p>

<p>
V(B) = -1/3 + V(C)
</p>

<p>
V(C) = -1/3 + V(A)
</p>

<p>
One solution to this is V(A) = 0, V(B) = -2/3, V(C) = -1/3 (<i>note: I actually dunno how to do this very basic step without just setting V(A) to 0. Maybe I should go back to middle school. Claude seems to think it's normal to do this but I don't really get why it works.</i>) 
</p>

<p>
the sequence of &delta;<sub>t</sub> errors following \(R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t} +\hat{v}(S_{t+1}, w_t) - \hat{v}(S_t, w)\) would be
</p>

<p>
(2/3 + 0 - 2/3), (-1/3 + -1/3 - -2/3), (-1/3 + 0 - -1/3)
</p>

<p>
or
</p>

<p>
0, 0, 0, &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
That is, the latter is more stable because if the reward and states are right, it doesn't perform updates at all, whereas the other one will cause oscillations since the updates aren't all 0.

In the differential semi-gradient n-step Sarsa algorithm, the step-size
parameter on the average reward, , needs to be quite small so that R¯ becomes a good
long-term estimate of the average reward. Unfortunately, R¯ will then be biased by its
initial value for many steps, which may make learning inecient. Alternatively, one could
use a sample average of the observed rewards for R¯. That would initially adapt rapidly
but in the long run would also adapt slowly. As the policy slowly changed, R¯ would also
change; the potential for such long-term nonstationarity makes sample-average methods
ill-suited. In fact, the step-size parameter on the average reward is a perfect place to use
the unbiased constant-step-size trick from Exercise 2.7. Describe the specific changes
needed to the boxed algorithm for differential semi-gradient n-step Sarsa to use this
trick.
</p>

<p>
Per exercise 2.7, the constant-step-size trick is
</p>

<p>
\(\beta_n \doteq \alpha \bar{o}_n\)
</p>

<p>
where
</p>

<p>
\(\bar{o}_n \doteq \bar{o}_{n-1} + \alpha(1 - \bar{o}_{n-1})\)
</p>

<p>
So we'd have to make three primary changes to the algorithm for semi-gradient n-step sarsa.
</p>

<p>
First, we'd have to initialize \(\bar{o}_0\) at 0
</p>

<p>
Second, we'd have to replace \(\bar{R} \leftarrow \bar{R} + \beta\delta\) with \(\bar{R} \leftarrow \bar{R} + \alpha \bar{o}_n \delta\)
</p>

<p>
Finally, we'd have to repeatedly update \(\bar{o}_n\) after each action using \(\bar{o}_n \doteq \bar{o}_{n-1} + \alpha(1 - \bar{o}_{n-1})\)

A Bernoulli-logistic unit is a stochastic neuron-like unit used in some ANNs
