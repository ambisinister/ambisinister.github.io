I am anticipating needing to deeply understand Reinforcement Learning to properly do my job. Everybody says that <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf">this book</a> is the way to do that, so I'm working through it and doing the exercises. I'll be putting the exercises in this document along with some random thoughts I may have. I have done this on here <a href="https://planetbanatt.net/articles/probmods.html">before, with the textbook Probabilistic Models of Cognition</a>, so it will largely be the same as that. I am also roughly following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBKeNJ-JE_eyJHZ7XgBoAyb">the DeepMind x UCL Reinforcement Learning Course (2018)</a> which follows this book. I learn much better from reading and practicing compared to from watching and listening, but it doesn't hurt to attack the problem from all fronts.
</p>

<p>
I'll be checking my answers to the exercises with LLMs as I work through the book. The majority of these are near the beginning of the book (chapter 3 has almost 30 exercises, most chapters after have about 10, part III has one exercise total). Since my objective is to understand RL well enough to do research, I'm going to make a good faith effort to actually get through the whole book, including these less exercise-heavy chapters / ones not covered in the DeepMind course. We will see how well I stick to it, but I have some optimism. <b>Please Note: I give no guarantee of correctness for these exercises.</b> This is not an answer key, it's my attempt at fighting through a textbook to learn a new topic. 
</p>

<p>
Overall I have been finding this book to be very challenging. I really thought my programming background would help me a lot more than it has been, so struggling through the necessary notation has been pretty taxing.

This book is actually pretty surface level on deep RL so I'll probably need to read more papers for that. In particular I'm planning on reading through the code for <a href="https://docs.cleanrl.dev/">CleanRL</a> and some important relevant papers on top of reading this book.
</p>

<p>
This book's full content is roughly 2 semesters worth of material. The one semester version stops at chapter 10.
</p>

<p>
Arcade culture as multi-arm bandit problem
</p>

<p>
Evolutionary RL with parameter model merging crossover operations
</p>

<p>
spybots clone might be good environment to implement algos like MCTS

<h4 id="org7215813">Exercise 1.1: Self-Play</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7215813">
<p>
Suppose, instead of playing against a random opponent, the
reinforcement learning algorithm described above played against itself, with both sides
learning. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a different policy
for selecting moves?
</p>

<p>
I already know self-play already works for achieving high skill in RL tasks (see: alphago) but I do think it's possible for larger environments that policies learned through self-play to tunnel into behaviors which do not fully explore a very complex environment. I remember seeing some papers exploiting this by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00241">learning adversarial policies</a> that win by creating out-of-distribution states. But for something simple like tic-tac-toe I doubt it would cause huge problems, in the limit both will explore the space completely. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5c9fe40" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5c9fe40">Exercise 1.2: Symmetries</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5c9fe40">
<p>
Many tic-tac-toe positions appear different but are really
the same because of symmetries. How might we amend the learning process described
above to take advantage of this? In what ways would this change improve the learning
process? Now think again. Suppose the opponent did not take advantage of symmetries.
In that case, should we? Is it true, then, that symmetrically equivalent positions should
necessarily have the same value?
</p>

<p>
We could take advantage of this via data augmentation in training, applying all the different rotations and mirrors to the game board and having 8 training examples instead of 1 per episode. This would make us equally strong from all angles, since we will have an equal balance of the different versions of the same positions. Taking advantage of the symmetries shouldn't have any different effects whether or not our opponent uses them or not &#x2013; they're literally identical states, and should have identical value functions as a result. One thing which may break this is if we learn that our opponent is worse at one particular rotation of the game board, and seeking to exploit that. If we do augmentation this way, we won't be able to learn that sort of thing, since we will be artificially improving their performance in those spots, but in exchange we get more training examples and better balance subject to symmetry.

<div id="outline-container-org7d3011a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7d3011a">Exercise 1.3: Greedy Play</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7d3011a">
<p>
Suppose the reinforcement learning player was greedy, that is,
it always played the move that brought it to the position that it rated the best. Might it
learn to play better, or worse, than a nongreedy player? What problems might occur?
</p>

<p>
If the player was greedy and never explored, that could lead to lots of problems where states get assigned incorrect value estimations. For example, if you have an action which causes +1 reward 90% of the time and -1 reward 10% of the time, and you happen to get -1 reward the first time you take that option, your estimation for that action is likely to be irrecoverably wrong. The purpose of non-greedy decisions is to make sure that your "rating the best" is actually accurate, since over time you'll get a better picture of more types of states that way. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgebc8d95" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgebc8d95">Exercise 1.4: Learning from Exploration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgebc8d95">
<p>
Suppose learning updates occurred after all
moves, including exploratory moves. If the step-size parameter is appropriately reduced
over time (but not the tendency to explore), then the state values would converge to
a different set of probabilities. What (conceptually) are the two sets of probabilities
computed when we do, and when we do not, learn from exploratory moves? Assuming
that we do continue to make exploratory moves, which set of probabilities might be better
to learn? Which would result in more wins?
</p>

<p>
Consider a case where you have a state which is next to the goal state, and also next to a state which kills you. In the greedy case, you would love to be in this state, because then you can go to the goal state, and you'll get very high reward. But in the exploration-enabled case, this state is kind of risky because there's a change you'll decide to explore in this state, land in the death state, and recieve a big negative reward. If you learn after exploratory moves, you're learning the value of the state including that probability of randomly dying, whereas otherwise you aren't. If you want to keep doing this exploration, you might be better off using these probabilities, since avoiding death is pretty important, but if you plan on turning those moves off then there's no need to avoid this hypothetical state.

<h4 id="orge6f3ea4">Exercise 1.5: Other Improvements</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge6f3ea4">
<p>
Can you think of other ways to improve the reinforcement learning player? Can you think of any better way to solve the tic-tac-toe problem as posed?
</p>

<p>
Arming the player with search seems like a good way to get better estimates of the current state.

In the comparison shown in Figure 2.2, which method will perform best in
the long run in terms of cumulative reward and probability of selecting the best action?
How much better will it be? Express your answer quantitatively.
</p>

<p>
In the long run. \eps = 0.01 will perform best. \eps = 0.1 learns the
optimal action the fastest, but is bottlenecked by the fact that it
must select a random action 10% of the time, meaning it gets optimal
reward 91% of the time. In comparison, once \eps = 0.01 learns the
optimal action, it will pick that option 99.5% of the time. You can
observe this in the slopes of the figure, where 0.01 is initially
lower but continues to grow.

The results shown in Figure 2.3 should be quite reliable
because they are averages over 2000 individual, randomly chosen 10-armed bandit tasks.
Why, then, are there oscillations and spikes in the early part of the curve for the optimistic
method? In other words, what might make this method perform particularly better or
worse, on average, on particular early steps? ⇤
</p>

<p>
If the rewards are optimistic, it's very likely that you will pull all the levers once after only a few turns, since you'll be disappointed each time. You should then get a good picture of the best one very quickly, which means you should pick the best option very often very early on. However, you run into a problem &#x2013; greedily picking that option will make your estimate of that state worse, so by picking it you temporarily make it less likely to be selected again. This will continue until the estimates are accurate enough for selecting the best option to not make the estimate worse than the estimates for the other options.

In most of this chapter we have used
sample averages to estimate action values because sample averages do not produce the
initial bias that constant step sizes do (see the analysis leading to (2.6)). However, sample
averages are not a completely satisfactory solution because they may perform poorly
on nonstationary problems. Is it possible to avoid the bias of constant step sizes while
retaining their advantages on nonstationary problems? One way is to use a step size of

<p>
\(\beta_n \doteq \alpha / \bar{o}_n\)

<p>
In Figure 2.4 the UCB algorithm shows a distinct spike
in performance on the 11th step. Why is this? Note that for your answer to be fully
satisfactory it must explain both why the reward increases on the 11th step and why it
decreases on the subsequent steps. Hint: If c = 1, then the spike is less prominent. ⇤
</p>

<p>
If you have 10 bandits after only a few trials, the UCB term will likely dominate for untested bandits, so it will test all the bandits once each in the first ten trials. On the 11th trial, all of the UCB terms will be equal, so it's very likely to pull the bandit which returned the highest value, which is most often the optimal one. However, once you do that, you reduce the UCB term for that bandit, which means that you'll start wanting to pull the other bandits again. This will repeat until the UCB term goes to ~0 after many trials. When c=1, this term is less dominating, so it becomes more possible to select two bandits twice in the first 10 trials, which would diffuse this spike to adjacent timesteps.

Suppose you face a 2-armed bandit task whose true action values change
randomly from time step to time step. Specifically, suppose that, for any time step,
the true values of actions 1 and 2 are respectively 10 and 20 with probability 0.5 (case
A), and 90 and 80 with probability 0.5 (case B). If you are not able to tell which case
you face at any step, what is the best expected reward you can achieve and how should
you behave to achieve it? Now suppose that on each step you are told whether you are
facing case A or case B (although you still don’t know the true action values). This is an
associative search task. What is the best expected reward you can achieve in this task,
and how should you behave to achieve it?
</p>

<p>
If you don't know the state, you do the same on both cases. picking action A will give you (10 + 90)/2 = 50 and action B will give you (20 + 80)/2 = 50 on average, so you can't do better than random. If you know what state you're in, you will want to select 2 in case A and 1 in case B, which will give you (20 + 90) / 2 = 55 average reward. Once you know the state, you collapse to the normal learning problem in a k-armed bandit, so any of those methods would work once you know the underlying state.

<p>
Maybe not usefully; a big component of this is that MDPs have the markov property (where the past sequence of events is priced into the current state, and two identical "states" which would have different local behaviors based on the path required to reach them would get represented as different states). It's possible there are MDPs it's hard to represent the state as being independent of / inclusive of the entire history prior (i.e. it is possible, but the state space is so large that the dynamics can't be learned well). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaStar_(software)">Starcraft</a> might be one of these?

Consider the problem of driving. You could define the actions in terms of
the accelerator, steering wheel, and brake, that is, where your body meets the machine.
Or you could define them farther out—say, where the rubber meets the road, considering
your actions to be tire torques. Or you could define them farther in—say, where your
brain meets your body, the actions being muscle twitches to control your limbs. Or you
could go to a really high level and say that your actions are your choices of where to drive.
What is the right level, the right place to draw the line between agent and environment?
On what basis is one location of the line to be preferred over another? Is there any
fundamental reason for preferring one location over another, or is it a free choice? ⇤
</p>

<p>
I imagine your framing matters a lot here. If you want to build a system which outperforms humans at driving, you'll likely be interested in defining it at the machine level (unless you were building a humanoid robot which drives) because in that case you're able to directly actuate the pedals and stuff. If you're building a gps navigation service which arrives at a location while avoiding the most traffic, you don't actually care about the machine at all. If you're drunk at a bar, you hopefully would carefully consider that your body's condition introduces an additional level of uncertainty to your observations and actions, even though your car in the parking lot didn't change at all. It's not so much that it's a free choice, rather that it depends on the type of problem you are attempting to solve with your agent.

<p>
The equations in Section 3.1 are for the continuing case and need to be
modified (very slightly) to apply to episodic tasks. Show that you know the modifications
needed by giving the modified version of (3.3).
</p>

<p>
continuing case:
</p>

<p>
\(\sum_{s' \in S} \sum_{r \in R} p(s', r | s, a) = 1 \text{ for all } s \in S, a \in A(s)\)
</p>

<p>
episodic case:
</p>

<p>
\(\sum_{s' \in S \cup T} \sum_{r \in R} p(s', r | s, a) = 1 \text{ for all } s \in S, a \in A(s) \text{ where T is the set of terminal states }\)
</p>

<p>
Exercise 3.6 Suppose you treated pole-balancing as an episodic task but also used
discounting, with all rewards zero except for -1 upon failure. What then would the
return be at each time? How does this return differ from that in the discounted, continuing
formulation of this task? ⇤
</p>

<p>
\(G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{T} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\)
</p>

<p>
Since R is always 0 except at the terminal state, we can just write this simply as
</p>

<p>
\(G_t = -\gamma^T\)
</p>

<p>
This differs from the discounted, continuing formulation of this task because the reward in the continuous case the model will get negative reward every time it's not balancing, but if it falls it can right itself again to resume having no penalty. In the episodic case, it will just reset so that you start again, and you're directly maximizing the time to first failure rather than the minimum number of failures as late as possible.

Imagine that you are designing a robot to run a maze. You decide to give it a
reward of +1 for escaping from the maze and a reward of zero at all other times. The task
seems to break down naturally into episodes—the successive runs through the maze—so
you decide to treat it as an episodic task, where the goal is to maximize expected total
reward (3.7). After running the learning agent for a while, you find that it is showing
no improvement in escaping from the maze. What is going wrong? Have you effectively
communicated to the agent what you want it to achieve? ⇤
</p>

<p>
If you do this, the agent will try to get out of the maze eventually, with no rush at all for how long that takes. As a result, with a long enough time horizon, taking enough random actions will eventually reach the terminal state, and all trials will have the same reward (+1). You aren't making it learn the maze, you're just asking it to exist until the terminal state is reached, and then rewarding it. What you would prefer is punishing -1 for every time step, so that the agent is rewarded for getting out faster, which will incentivize it to actually learn to escape the maze.

In the gridworld example, rewards are positive for goals, negative for
running into the edge of the world, and zero the rest of the time. Are the signs of these
rewards important, or only the intervals between them? Prove, using (3.8), that adding a
constant c to all the rewards adds a constant, vc, to the values of all states, and thus
does not affect the relative values of any states under any policies. What is vc in terms
of c and ? ⇤
</p>

<p>
Only the differences are important if we're trying to maximize it, the signs are mostly useful to semantically describe which are rewards and which are punishments. The advantage of a good state over a bad one exists independent of sign.

\(G_t \doteq \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\)

\(G_t \doteq \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k c\)

Since it's a constant term (i.e. a sum of constants) We can define \(v_c = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k c\) so \(G_t \doteq \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} + v_c\)

<p>
In an episodic task, it does cause problems to add a constant to all values. Consider maze running. If you have a negative reward for each non-solved turn, and then a big positive reward at the end, your total reward is maximized by getting out of the maze as fast as possible. If you have a small positive reward for each non-solved turn, and then an even bigger reward at the end, your total reward is now maximized by existing in the maze for all eternity, since eventually you will accumulate more reward by deliberately not finding the exit and bounding your reward.

The policy iteration algorithm on page 80 has a subtle bug in that it may
never terminate if the policy continually switches between two or more policies that are
equally good. This is okay for pedagogy, but not for actual use. Modify the pseudocode
so that convergence is guaranteed. ⇤
</p>

<p>
The only way it's possible to repeatedly switch between policies that are equally good but not the same are if the resulting rewards from both states are the same. In this code we save the existing action &pi;(s) and then assign the action in that state to the argmax of the new values. All we have to do to avoid this bug is additionally store old-value which is just V(old-action), and then mark policy-stable as false if V(&pi;(s)) != V(old-action). We don't care if the action changes, we care if the policy improves.

and it should be good from there (plus changing initialization and updating policy with max q instead of v, of course). The important part is that since you're not keeping track of V(s), you have to expand it out in terms of Q, which involves the all the possible actions over the next state.

Write a program for policy iteration and re-solve Jack’s car
rental problem with the following changes. One of Jack’s employees at the first location
rides a bus home each night and lives near the second location. She is happy to shuttle
one car to the second location for free. Each additional car still costs $2, as do all cars
moved in the other direction. In addition, Jack has limited parking space at each location.
If more than 10 cars are kept overnight at a location (after any moving of cars), then an
additional cost of $4 must be incurred to use a second parking lot (independent of how
many cars are kept there). These sorts of nonlinearities and arbitrary dynamics often
occur in real problems and cannot easily be handled by optimization methods other than
dynamic programming. To check your program, first replicate the results given for the

If you imagine the all flip at 50 being 0.4 probability to win, betting 1 at 51 means you are adding the probability of getting 50 more points starting with 1 to the fixed probability of 0.4, making it strictly better.

Honestly, no. The value and policy both do converge, given enough timesteps, but the form they take is pretty unusual. I wonder if there are multiple optimal actions for each state, and the wild behavior of the policy is not preferring one type of state to the other?

It jumps up because those are the ones you stick and often win. It drops off on the left because if the dealer has a usable ace they're more likely to win also.

Consider an MDP with a single nonterminal state and a single action
that transitions back to the nonterminal state with probability p and transitions to the
terminal state with probability 1p. Let the reward be +1 on all transitions, and let
 = 1. Suppose you observe one episode that lasts 10 steps, with a return of 10. What
are the first-visit and every-visit estimators of the value of the nonterminal state? ⇤
</p>

<p>
The first-visit should be \(V(S) = G_0\) which refers to the episode reward, NOT the immediate reward. So in this case, it would be 10.
</p>

<p>
First visit it will be 10 like above. Second visit it will be 9 (since we lose the reward from the first transition). This will get added to returns which will make it [10,9], and the average is 9.5. This will continue [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], and the average of this is 55/10 = 5.5.

What is the equation analogous to (5.6) for action values Q(s, a) instead of

<p>
I actually think it should be pretty much the same? We need to change \(t \in T(s)\) to be instead \(t \in T(s, a)\) but p is already in terms of the actions of each policy rather than as states, and we are doing it episode by episode which means its the same episode but in terms of the state-action transitions rather than the states alone.

In learning curves such as those shown in Figure 5.3 error generally decreases
with training, as indeed happened for the ordinary importance-sampling method. But for
the weighted importance-sampling method error first increased and then decreased. Why
do you think this happened? ⇤
</p>

<p>
Weighted importance sampling starts from a biased estimation and updates a ratio towards the other policy, compared to ordinary importance sampling which monotonically increases the denominator. With OIS, the variance is high that improving with more samples is much larger than the effect of having only a few samples, but with WIS, you'll likely need a few samples before it starts heading in the right direction, which could lead to a temporary increase in error.

<p>
The variance would definitely still be infinite if we used an every-visit MC method. Because the importance sampling ratio is the same in both cases, each step is still 2<sup>k</sup> which is unbounded and diverging.

Consider driving a race car around a turn
like those shown in Figure 5.5. You want to go as fast as possible, but not so fast as
to run o↵ the track. In our simplified racetrack, the car is at one of a discrete set of
grid positions, the cells in the diagram. The velocity is also discrete, a number of grid
cells moved horizontally and vertically per time step. The actions are increments to the
velocity components. Each may be changed by +1, 1, or 0 in each step, for a total of
nine (3 ⇥ 3) actions. Both velocity components are restricted to be nonnegative and less
than 5, and they cannot both be zero except at the starting line. Each episode begins
in one of the randomly selected start states with both velocity components zero and
ends when the car crosses the finish line. The rewards are 1 for each step until the car
crosses the finish line. If the car hits the track boundary, it is moved back to a random
position on the starting line, both velocity components are reduced to zero, and the
episode continues. Before updating the car’s location at each time step, check to see if
the projected path of the car intersects the track boundary. If it intersects the finish line,
the episode ends; if it intersects anywhere else, the car is considered to have hit the track
boundary and is sent back to the starting line. To make the task more challenging, with
probability 0.1 at each time step the velocity increments are both zero, independently of
the intended increments. Apply a Monte Carlo control method to this task to compute
the optimal policy from each starting state. Exhibit several trajectories following the
optimal policy (but turn the noise off for these trajectories). ⇤

This is an exercise to help develop your intuition about why TD methods
are often more ecient than Monte Carlo methods. Consider the driving home example
and how it is addressed by TD and Monte Carlo methods. Can you imagine a scenario
in which a TD update would be better on average than a Monte Carlo update? Give
an example scenario—a description of past experience and a current state—in which
you would expect the TD update to be better. Here’s a hint: Suppose you have lots
of experience driving home from work. Then you move to a new building and a new
parking lot (but you still enter the highway at the same place). Now you are starting
to learn predictions for the new building. Can you see why TD updates are likely to be
much better, at least initially, in this case? Might the same sort of thing happen in the
original scenario?
</p>

<p>
In the new case where you have a new final destination, an important note is that your initial path home from work is the same in both cases (getting on and off the highway in the same spots). As a result, you already know how long those time steps take, and the likely difference in total time between those states is likely to be the exact same. In TD learning, the important thing is that your early states stay similar relative to each other, and that you figure out your new trailing states. In MC methods, you need to completely update all the states to predict the final time, which resets everything since every state directly learns the resulting dynamics of everything after it.
</p>

<p>
In the original scenario, this might happen too. If a road is closed and one leg is now abnormally slow, the rest of the state value estimates might still be pretty accurate relative to each other, compared to MC methods which do not handle this type of case well.

From the results shown in the left graph of the random walk example it
appears that the first episode results in a change in only V(A). What does this tell you
about what happened on the first episode? Why was only the estimate for this one state
changed? By exactly how much was it changed?
</p>

<p>
It makes sense that only one state updated. The only two states that can update in TD learning with equal initialization like this are the ones next to the terminal states. The middle ones all update to \(V(S_t) + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)]\) which in this case is V(S<sub>t</sub>) + 0 + (1 * 0.5) - 0.5 which is just V(S<sub>t</sub>). The right state can update upwards, but only if the episode actually visits that state (and it can only go to one of the states. In our case here, V(A) will update to 0.5 + 0.1[0 + 1*0 - 0.5] which equals 0.45, which checks out in the diagram.

<p>
The specific results shown in the right graph of the random walk example
are dependent on the value of the step-size parameter, &alpha;. Do you think the conclusions
about which algorithm is better would be affected if a wider range of &alpha; values were used?
Is there a different, fixed value of &alpha; at which either algorithm would have performed
significantly better than shown? Why or why not? 
</p>

<p>
For this problem it makes sense that TD methods are more sample efficient. MC methods rely heavily upon the fact that you can arrive at the value of the state after sampling lots of episode returns and averaging them for each state. TD methods will instead increment based on the estimates of surrounding states, which makes it more like a combination of DP methods and MC methods. I can imagine that there are very unwise alpha values for which TD methods may fail to converge, though, for example if &alpha; = 1, V(A) in our last example would be assigned a new value of 0, which seems bad. In this case, MC methods would still be making updates based on the total returns, while TD methods only get to consider adjacent states, which might make them more likely to diverge instead of converge.

Why is Q-learning considered an <i>off-policy</i> control method?

<p>
Q-learning is considered an off-policy control method because it directly approximates the optimal action-value function but doesn't use that function to actually select actions to perform this calculation. This makes it different from Sarsa, which will use the Q value of the action actually taken from S<sub>t+1</sub>, compared to Q learning which performs the update using the maximum Q value available from S<sub>t+1</sub> (even if it decides to do something else)

<p>
If action selection is greedy, then \(max_a Q(S_{t+1}, a) = Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})\), meaning Sarsa and Q-learning are the same. The difference here is that if you want to add an exploratory policy, Sarsa would use that policy to update, but Q-learning would use the same greedy action selection regardless of what action is actually taken. Note: this also assumes that ties are broken the same way. If they differ then obviously they are no longer the same, but I'm assuming from the way the question is asked that this means "if the actions are always the same"

In Jack's Car Rental, your "move" is how many cars you move from location A to location B (which can be negative, if you want to move cars from B to A). The "opponent move" is how many cars get added or subtracted from each location (i.e. from rentals and returns).
</p>

<p>
In this situation, you will often arrive at the same number of cars in both locations even if all of these numbers vary a lot (i.e. I have 0 and 3, I move -1 to get 1 and 2, location A has 1 return, location B has 1 rental, leading to 2 and 1. This is the same, for example, as starting with 2 and 1, doing 0 moves, and having 3 rentals and 3 returns in each situation). The number of possible paths spirals out to a dramatically high number (since many values can vary) but the actual resulting states is limited to just that 20x20 box, so framing it as the resulting number before doing the update is much more likely to lead to fast convergence since you'll be able to cross-learn from different situations.

In Chapter 6 we noted that the Monte Carlo error can be written as the
sum of TD errors (6.6) if the value estimates don’t change from step to step. Show that
the n-step error used in (7.2) can also be written as a sum of TD errors (again if the
value estimates don’t change) generalizing the earlier result.
</p>

<p>
Recall the TD Error
</p>

<p>
\(\delta_t \doteq R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\)
</p>

<p>
The n-step error here is the bracketed part of 7.2:
</p>

<p>
\(V_{t+n}(S_t) \doteq V_{t+n-1}(S_t) + \alpha [G_{t:t+n} - V_{t+n-1}(S_t)]\)
</p>

<p>
Since the values won't change we can just write it as V from now on.
</p>

<p>
The n-step return is:
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n})\)
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n}) - V(S_t)\)
</p>

<p>
For this last step, we can add and subtract the same values like so:
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n}) + \gamma^{n-1} V(S_{t+n-1}) - \gamma^{n-1} V(S_{t+n-1}) + ... - V(S_t)\)
</p>

<p>
Rearranging we get
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) + R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 V(S_{t+2}) - \gamma V(S_{t+1}) + ... + R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n}) - \gamma^{n-1} V(S_{t+n-1})\)
</p>

<p>
Which is
</p>

<p>
\(G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = \delta_t + \gamma \delta_{t+1} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} \delta_{t+n}\)

With an n-step method, the value estimates do change from step to
step, so an algorithm that used the sum of TD errors (see previous
exercise) in place of the error in (7.2) would actually be a slightly
di↵erent algorithm. Would it be a better algorithm or a worse one?

<p>
Why do you think a larger random walk task (19 states instead of 5) was
used in the examples of this chapter? Would a smaller walk have shifted the advantage
to a different value of n? How about the change in left-side outcome from 0 to -1 made
in the larger walk? Do you think that made any difference in the best value of n?
</p>

<p>
With a shorter random walk task, it takes fewer n for your n-step method to pretty much be a MC method (barring the very unlikely extremes, which are truncated). It seems unlikely that you'd get as interesting separation in this experiment compared to the version with the longer walk. The left-side value being -1 seems unlikely to make too much of a difference, since we initialize halfway between the two values and update towards or away from one of the endpoints in both cases. But since it's higher magnitude in both directions, it might propogate higher values farther for larger values of n? It seems unlikely to change the dynamics much though, as written.

<p>
Replace (e) with a table of state transitions and rewards, and instead of just taking from it you sample from it instead. This might perform poorly because you'll take a long time to notice changes in the environment, since you'll just have to keep updating until the new change dwarfs the old one, so to make it handle changing environments you could keep a sort of running table of the most recent \(k\) visits to that state, instead of every one, which will naturally kill off information from older visits.
