<i>Last Updated 02-05-22</i>
</p>

<p>
Over the last several months I have been drinking a lot of energy drinks as a slightly more fun way of consuming caffeine before workouts / focus sessions, and I thought I would assemble a list of my thoughts on each one.
</p>

<p>
Given that my ability to obtain random single flavors has been significantly hampered by the global pandemic happening right now, I've decided I'm just going to upload what I have right now and then add to it slowly as I accrue more and more flavors. So far I've tried about 30, so expect this list to grow as I go on this journey. 
</p>

<h3 id="org169700a">Energy Drinks are Expensive!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org169700a">
<p>
Energy drinks are not an efficient means of doing anything. If you want caffeine in the cheapest way possible, purchase caffeine tablets off of amazon. They are like $0.04 per 100mg serving, meaning you can just take one or two with some tap water and immediately have 90%+ of the same effect of monster or whatever. If you want preworkout, add on some <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/">beta alanine</a> and <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/citrulline/">citrulline</a>, which provide some muscular endurance and fatigue/soreness reduction, respectively. If you want to shell out the money for a fun can of almost soda which has some useful things in it, feel free to drink energy drinks. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgce51d9b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgce51d9b">Energy Drinks are Not Good Preworkouts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgce51d9b">
<p>
This is correct, usually they're not as good as actual preworkouts for use as preworkouts. But caffeine really gets you 90% of the way there, and it's more fun to try 30 flavors of energy drink over the course of a few weeks rather than try 30 different tubs of preworkout over the course of probably years. If your energy drink doesn't have citrulline or whatever, just take some with it.

<h3 id="orgce21598">Energy Drinks are Bad For You</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgce21598">
<p>
Of course they are bad for you. That said, the badness of energy drinks is, I find, <a href="https://examine.com/nutrition/are-energy-drinks-bad-for-you/">vastly</a> <a href="https://examine.com/nutrition/the-mild-health-risks-of-energy-drinks/">overstated</a> especially when explicitly paired with stuff like resistance training, for which their active ingredients frequently help out with <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-007-0557-x">strength</a> and <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/12b4/7c27f774c7968b80d8309a3300a9a9901f09.pdf">anaerobic capability</a>. You obviously don't want to go nuts with these things but as long as you stay under the FDA's safe zone of 400mg per day from all sources it's really not going to be the worst thing in the world (probably).

<h3 id="orgdab7bbd">Just Drink Water!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdab7bbd">
<p>
Water doesn't have caffeine in it. Mixing caffeine with water tastes awful. I drink plenty of water, and generally speaking don't drink more than one energy drink on any given day. Please, I beg you, go away.

TODO: Add more notes about the flavors of each of these.
</p>

<p>
Some keys:
</p>

<p>
\(^c\) - has a flavor a lot like candy; potentially overly sweet, which is a turnoff to some people
</p>

<p>
\(^m\) - contains milk, which I have a hard time drinking and usually docks points for me off of otherwise good drinks
</p>

<p>
\(^\uparrow\) - Has a lot of caffeine, usually labeled

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1a1a53a">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Monster Zero Ultra (white)</b> Perhaps sort of a meme to have this in S tier but my relatively informed opinion on this is that it is still quite good</li>
<li><b>Monster Green Tea</b> Not very common but amazing whenever I find it</li>
<li><b>Monster Rehab Green Tea</b> I think this is the same as the above? Need to do a side by side comparison</li>
<li><b>Mountain Dew energy Baja Blast</b> it tastes like baja blast and doesn't have calories; what more can you ask for?</li>
<li><b>Monster Rehab Lemonade + Ice Tea</b> Moved this up because I drink it all the time and it doesn't ever get old</li>

<li><b>Monster Ultra Sunrise (Orange)</b> Pretty much orange soda</li>
<li><b>Monster Ultra Blue</b> Possible S tier, need to try again</li>
<li><b>Reign Sour Apple</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\) You will probably like it if you think "caffeinated green jolly rancher" sounds appealing to you</li>
<li><b>Reign Blue Razz</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Monster Ultra Red</b> \(^c\)</li>
<li><b>Mtn Dew Rise Tropical Sunrise</b> These all taste different but similar to monster they all land in about the same spot, very consistent</li>
<li><b>Mtn Dew Rise Berry Blitz</b></li>
<li><b>Mtn Dew Rise Pomegranate Blue Burst</b></li>
<li><b>Mtn Dew Rise Orange Breeze</b></li>
<li><b>Ghost Blue Raspberry Sour Patch Kids</b> epic gamer branding but unfortunately very tasty</li>
<li><b>Reign Lychee</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\) probably more like A- but nothing else has a lychee flavor so it gets points for that</li>
<li><b>Reign Mango</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\) Would probably like this more if I liked mango in general more, but it is a good flavor</li>
<li><b>Monster Ultra Paradise (Green)</b> \(^c\) see reign sour apple, but more sickly sweet</li>
<li><b>3D Strawberry (Chrome)</b> \(^{\uparrow 200mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Mtn Dew Rise Strawberry Melon Spark</b></li>
<li><b>Sugar Free Red Bull</b> Moved up since price for these is less important now that I can just get them for free at work</li>

<li><b>Reign Gummy Bear</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\) could be argued for A, fruit roll up vibes, a little too sweet but I mean it's called gummy bear flavor</li>
<li><b>Reign Orange Dreamsicle</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\) orange cream flavor definitely very well captured imo</li>
<li><b>Ghost Orange Cream</b></li>
<li><b>Ultra Energy</b> Serbian energy drink I encountered at a Chinese grocery store. Couldn’t really read the label well but I think it had about 80ish mg caffeine and it tasted like Red Bull but slightly fruitier</li>
<li><b>Rockstar Focus Honeydew Melon</b> There aren't many honeydew energy drinks so I'm relieved that this is good</li>
<li><b>Reign Strawberry Sublime</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\)</li>
<li><b>C4 Starburst Cherry</b> very faithful to the starburst flavor</li>

<li><b>Monster Hydro Sugar Free</b></li>
<li><b>Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango</b></li>
<li><b>Rip It TRIBUTE Active Mandarin Lime</b> These are apparently popular on military bases according to my friend that works in the energy drink industry. It feels a bit weird since it's <a href="https://d2lnr5mha7bycj.cloudfront.net/product-image/file/large_b01d3f5a-d1c3-437c-8c3e-d074e97d2c45.jpg">got camo and a little drawing of a soldier on it</a>, but I got it at the dollar store with low expectations and it was not bad at all.</li>
<li><b>Monster Hydro Blue Streak</b></li>
<li><b>Ghost Red Berry</b></li>
<li><b>Celsius Peach Vibe</b> Good muted flavor, good if you're not a big energy drink person but like sparkling water</li>

<li><b>Celsius Live Fit Sparkling Orange</b> Tastes similar to uptime but more yuppie and less nerdy; also has l-theanine</li>
<li><b>Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle</b> only slightly worse than the other orange cream flavors on this list, but also not sugar free which bumps it down.</li>
<li><b>Monster Rehab Lemonade + Tea</b></li>
<li><b>Rockstar Focus Passionfruit Mango</b></li>
<li><b>Reign Melon Mania</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Adrenaline Shoc Frozen Ice</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\)</li>

<li><b>Monster Ultra Vice Guava</b></li>
<li><b>Ignite Blue Raspberry</b> good, but with a weird aftertaste</li>
<li><b>3D Citrus Mist</b> \(^{\uparrow 200mg}\) nice mild taste, brand is pretty underrated in general I think</li>
<li><b>Bang Wylin Watermelon</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\) Wow! It's bang but it doesn't taste so bad! A first for me</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Kafeen water</b> this one requires some elaboration. It's marketed as "water with caffeine" and it <i>almost</i> delivers on that, it tastes sort of like spa water which was left out too long (my fiancee liked it though). But I put this in B tier despite it tasting a little weird because "water"'s neutral taste means you can mix it with things reasonably well. I put some Mio lemonade flavoring in this and it tasted great; A-/A level enjoyment. I felt weird about rewarding this for how it did not taste initially but it has enough of the properties of actual water to not be ranked in C tier or whatever.</li>
<li><b>Monster Java Mean Bean</b> Just shy of 200mg caffeine, tastes pretty good if you like coffee with milk but an unfortunate one if you are lactose intolerant.</li>
<li><b>Sting Energy</b> Vietnamese energy drink, tastes a bit like twizzlers. Docked for calorie content.</li>
<li><b>Ghost Sour Watermelon Warheads</b> good at first, but a bit too sweet afterwards</li>
<li><b>Triton Mango Fruit Punch</b></li>
<li><b>GFuel FaZe Berry</b></li>
<li><b>C4 Starburst Pink</b> Not as faithful to the taste as starburst cherry</li>
<li><b>Rockstar Lime Cucumber</b> It sounds like it would be awful but it was okay, cucumber taste is not very noticable</li>
<li><b>Rip It Citrus X</b></li>
<li><b>Huel Energy+ Blue Raspberry</b></li>
<li><b>Kill Cliff Fruit Punch Knockout</b> Probably more like C+ but the insanely psycho branding pushes it up here from novelty alone</li>
<li><b>Celsius Kiwi Guava</b> My SO liked this one, though; I just thought it was okay</li>
<li><b>Uptime, Sugarfree</b> notably has L-Theanine in it</li>
<li><b>Rockstar Juiced Island Mango</b></li>

<li><b>Positive Energy Zero Sugar Poppin Orange</b> Better than watermelon flavor but still bitter</li>
<li><b>Positive Energy Zero Sugar Watermelon Mania</b> Tastes kind of bitter honestly</li>
<li><b>Quake Berry Blast</b> Tastes like bang but less awful</li>
<li><b>Adrenaline Shoc Fruit Punch</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\) Tastes like overly sweet fruit punch</li>
<li><b>ALANI NV Electic Tye Dye Cherry Limeade</b> This brand is mostly okay but there are some iffy ones</li>
<li><b>Bang Berry Bangster</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Adrenaline Shoc Mango Peach</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Beyond Raw Burn MF Gummy Worm</b> really thought this would taste awful from the branding but no lie it was pretty good</li>
<li><b>Gfuel Red Licorice</b></li>
<li><b>Monster Ultra Peach</b> tastes like peach rings, pretty good but a clear worst among monster ultra flavors imo</li>
<li><b>Reign Thermogenic Watermelon Warlord</b></li>
<li><b>Rockstar Super Sour Green Apple</b> As it says on the label, it is super sour</li>
<li><b>Reign Inferno Red Dragon</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Rockstar Recovery Orange</b></li>
<li><b>Triton Strawberry Kiwi</b></li>
<li><b>Rockstar Pure Zero Silver Ice</b></li>
<li><b>Adrenaline Shoc Sour Candy</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\) it's very, very sour</li>

<li><b>Uptime, Original Citrus</b> think "capri sun for adults", also has L-theanine in it</li>

<li><b>Rockstar Focus Mixed Berry</b> Pretty sure this just uses the same flavoring as Celsius Wild Berry, which is bad. It's interesting that this has Lion's Mane in it though, so it gets marginal points as a result.</li>
<li><b>Melting Forest Mushroom Energy Mango Guava</b> This didn't taste like an energy drink so much as it tasted like a bunch of herbal supplements dissolved into water. Not sure how you get "mango guava" from this but the ingredients list is at least interesting.</li>
<li><b>Celsius Wild Berry</b> Coffee taste is weirdly strong, makes it not taste good</li>
<li><b>C4 Grape</b> \(^{\uparrow 200mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Reign Inferno True Blu</b> \(^{\uparrow 300mg}\)</li>
<li><b>Raze Sour Gummy Worm</b> \(^{c \uparrow 300mg}\) really thought this would be better than the voodoo flavor but was unfortunately mistaken</li>

<li><b>Aspire Cranberry</b></li>
<li><b>Breinfuel Mixed Berry</b> \(^{\uparrow 360mg}\) not a typo, actually has 360mg caffeine. I am pretty sure this makes it illegal to sell as a beverage so I actually found this in a CVS vitamin aisle away from all the energy drinks. It tasted pretty terrible but I put it in C+ just for the guts it takes to put a borderline dangerous amount of caffeine in a single bottle.</li>

<h3 id="org391fb33">Caffeine Content</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org391fb33">
<p>
I really can't stress how mind-bending it is to me that so many of these drinks contain 300 milligrams of caffeine in them. For scale, that's something like 3-5 cups of coffee, all at once in one beverage. A number of the below drinks contain that amount and I certainly cannot recommend them unless you are explicitly going to exert yourself in some way immediately after (e.g. lifting weights).

<h3 id="org900497f">Sugar Content / Calories</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org900497f">
<p>
I have a very strong preference against drinks with sugar / caloric content in general. You might think this is because I think they add empty calories in exchange for no actual nutritional benefits. You would be half right, but I also think generally speaking non-diet soda just tastes pretty terrible (see: diet coke vs regular coke). As such please keep in mind that I have this relatively extreme bias, and that most of the sugary energy drinks are ranked fairly low as a consequence.

<h3 id="org144f346">I Wish There Were More Samplers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org144f346">
<p>
Generally speaking, I don't know how you could arrive at opinions about this sort of thing unless you get to try tons and tons of flavors. I know wine people have wine tasting parties where you drink a sip or two of many different kinds of wines, and I am a bit frustrated that I'm doing the caffeine equivalent of buying many bottles of wine, even if I end up hating the bottle. Likewise preworkout doesn't usually come in single serving packets (and even if they did, they would be all the same flavor), so I wish there was a generally more efficient way of doing this compared to just purchasing tons of things and then finishing them.
