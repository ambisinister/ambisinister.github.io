<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6164dc4">
<p>
The manga <i>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer</i> features an antagonist called Maimakterion, a golem which is imbued with self-awareness. I argue that Maimakterion is the most compelling fictional depiction of an <i>Agent AI</i>; a non-human entity which bootstraps from human knowledge until it attains a convincing facsimile of humanity itself. Unlike traditional golems or robots whose humanity is granted or programmed into them, Maimakterion becomes himself through information absorption, making him an ideal vehicle for exploring questions around human consciousness.

<h2 id="org71c513e"><i>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer</i></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org71c513e">
<p>
Between 2005 and 2010, a mangaka by the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Mizukami">Satoshi Mizukami</a> wrote a ten-volume piece titled <i>Hoshi no Samidare</i>, transliterated in the west as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_and_the_Biscuit_Hammer">Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer</a></i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. It follows a misanthropic college student who is suddenly thrust the responsibility of being a <i>Beast Knight</i>, part of a band of warriors whose purpose is to defeat a mage named Animus who wants to destroy the world with a giant mallet called the Biscuit Hammer.
</p>

<p>
Animus primarily battles the beast knights by his command of magic which creates <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">Golems</a></i>. This is just one of several magical abilities that appear in <i>Biscuit Hammer</i> (one of the Beast Knights can create these as well), but Animus has a particularly strong command over this type of construct. These golems slowly grow more powerful over time: they are named for months in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_calendar">Attic calendar</a>, beginning in the winter (Gamelion) and ending with the 12th golem at the end of Autumn (Poseideon). These display some very limited capacity for simple emotions, but are largely just very powerful fighting automata.

The <i>self</i> is a concept which is explored in great detail throughout <i>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer</i>, and the most direct of this is the names of the goddess <i>Anima</i> and the mage <i>Animus</i>. These are terms from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_in_Jungian_psychology">Carl Jung</a>'s work: in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious">collective unconscious</a>, <i>animus</i> refers to the unconscious masculine component in the mind of a woman, whereas <i>anima</i> refers to the unconscious feminine component in the mind of a man. These figures (Samidare as the avatar of the goddess Anima, and the mage Animus) frequently appear to characters in dreams, &lt;which is of course another important component in Jungian psychology&gt;

<p>
Animus' 11th golem is notably different from the previous ones. While Animus' golems tend to be powerful (especially the final three <i>divine bodies</i>), they appear to follow straightforwardly hostile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_action_pattern">fixed action patterns</a>, suggesting they are essentially hand-programmed to fight the Beast Knights. In comparison, the 11th Golem Maimakterion is instead a relatively formless one: a <i>tabula rasa</i> golem which is instead imbued with general intelligence and instructed to learn and assume its most powerful form.
</p>

<p>
The arcs leading up to Maimakterion's introduction spend considerable effort seemingly laying the foundation for the argument that inner experience, rather than knowledge, is what makes us human. The swordfish knight goes so far as to make this explicit: a character who can see the future, who repeatly displays surprise when his subjective experience differs from the purely informational content of his precognition. <i>Omniscience is pointless</i>.
</p>


<div id="org7342c04" class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
And in the lead-up there is substantial foreshadowing that the beast knights will need to fight a human opponent. The intent of this is to convince the reader that there is going to be violent conflict between the beast knights&#x2026;
</p>


<div id="org1975e27" class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
&#x2026;but we quickly ascertain that this is a red herring. In chapter 39 we see Maimakterion's entrance: a golem which initially appears before the cast as their deceased friend, in a convincing human-like form, able to shapeshift between bodies at will. Even more shocking: when Amamiya asks it a question, it speaks a response.

<p>
It's later shown that Maimakterion's trick is that he reads books. Taiyou makes several trips from the library to bring him huge stacks of books about completely random topics: books about how to write, manga, etc. Later he starts to watch movies, travel around, and rely on Taiyou for explanations about things. Maimakterion's two powers are shapeshifting and a desire for knowledge: he freely assumes forms from both genders, and relies upon prior examples to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators">convincingly simulate an assumed role</a>.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
As he continues to read and experience more and more, Maimakterion begins to grow confused about the boundary between human and golem. He's a transforming magical construct who was supposed to use observed examples as a delivery vector for more effective transformation attacks, but partway through something curious happens: the facsimile of a sense of self begins to emerge.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
MAIMAKTERION: Taiyou&#x2026; Humans, what are they?
</p>

<p>
TAIYOU: Animals that evolved from monkeys, with better brains (I think?)
</p>

<p>
MAIMAKTERION: Is that all?
</p>

<p>
TAIYOU: Mmm&#x2026; There's things like souls I guess? I don't really know.
</p>

<p>
MAIMAKTERION: And what are golems?
</p>

<p>
TAIYOU: Animus' Minions?
</p>

<p>
MAIMAKTERION: &#x2026;I see. We were brought forth from Animus' psychic powers. Soldiers. I am a golem. You are a human. Is that all?
</p>

<p>
TAIYOU: No, there's all sorts of other things though.
</p>

<p>
MAIMAKTERION: Other things? A name, a purpose, a form&#x2026; What am I lacking? My self. What am I?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Maimakterion's character arc bears remarkable similarity to real-world <a href="https://planetbanatt.net/articles/deepseek.html">Large Language Models</a>. Abstracted away, Maimakterion is an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">artificial system</a> which has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">no explicit true form or instructions</a>, which consumes <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">a large corpus of information</a> about humanity, <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">through observation</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741">human feedback</a>, until it understands humans well enough to passably <i>be one</i>. To understand this, we need to understand both language models and traditional iconography surrounding golems.

<p>
Maimakterion is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">golem</a>, and <i>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer</i> is one of many in a very long series of stories involving creating automatons from dirt or clay. More pointedly, golems are often animated using the power of very important <i>words</i>. One example comes from Ted Chiang's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy-Two_Letters">Seventy-Two Letters</a> in which golems are automata which are animated by <i>names of god</i>, sequences of 72 hebrew letters which encode their behaviors. In <i>Seventy-Two Letters</i>, the equivalent of a mage is called a <i>nomenclator</i>, which is someone who crafts special names which allow the Golems to accomplish specific tasks. The relationship between words and golem behavior is a long-standing component of their iconography, and Maimakterion reaching his ultimate form specifically via reading books can be thought of, in a sense, as a golem which can program itself. From <i>72 Letters</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Roth’s epithet would indeed let an automaton do most of what was needed to reproduce. An automaton could cast a body identical to its own, write out its own name, and insert it to animate the body. It couldn’t train the new one in sculpture, though, since automata couldn’t speak. An automaton that could truly reproduce itself without human assistance remained out of reach, but coming this close would undoubtedly have delighted the kabbalists. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Maimakterion <i>can</i> speak, though, which distinguishes him from the original, canonical description of a golem. In the Talmud, God creates Adam out of mud and then breathes life into him, creating the first human. Animated golems have thus been a fundamental primitive in Jewish folklore for many years, where they can be interpreted as a sort of <i>unfinished human</i>. The primary distinguishing factor between humans and golems is precisely that inability to speak. The construct of <i>golem</i> is therefore a sort of statement about the relative difficulty of creating an autonomous machine vs creating one that can speak, and further can be interpreted as attaching inherent humanity to the act of speaking.
</p>

<p>
But what, then, is Maimakterion? Through the traditional framework, he represents a truly awkward middle ground for a golem: he is an automaton imitating human behavior, and yet he lacks the primary limitation a golem ought to have. Certainly not a human, and yet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes">Diogenes</a> would have paraded him before Plato endlessly. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">Language models</a> are very large neural networks (typically <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762">transformers</a>) which are trained on an extremely large body of text to predict the next word in a sequence. If you feed a next-word prediction back into itself (called <i>autoregression</i>), these models can output very large blocks of very convincing text. 
</p>

<p>
More relevant in popular culture are large language models (LLMs) which apply further post-training to make them <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155">follow instructions</a>, which lets you talk to them in natural language. At a very high level, this is how we arrive at systems like <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">chatGPT</a>, by scaling these systems up to very large sizes and <a href="https://planetbanatt.net/articles/deepseek.html">solving problems that appear along the way</a>. Modern, frontier LLMs are extremely powerful: they can write detailed code, solve difficult math problems, understand <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08485">documents and images</a>, and even <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1848742761278611504">get distracted by beautiful photos instead of accomplishing their provided tasks</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Language models can be viewed in some sense as the same sort of awkward golem as Maimakterion: an automaton created manifested through electricity and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i820xO9VADM">heavily processed sand</a>, given some rudimentary ability to act and speak. Interacting with powerful language models feels uncannily like interacting with a human, and there's some belief that continuing to make these systems larger and more powerful will lead us to <a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis">human-level or superhuman-level general intelligence</a>. Detractors of this technology believe that further developing large language models will lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence">irreverible global catastrophe</a>: a Biscuit Hammer lingering atop the world.
</p>

<p>
Drawing this parallel between language models and Maimakterion raises further questions about how far the comparison can be drawn: something about Maimakterion's characterization <i>feels</i> like it makes sense to treat him like a sentient being, whereas the equivalent question applied to LLM feels, at first glance, to be a little ridiculous. When Blake Lemoine made this (very early) claim for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a> in 2022 he was <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/06/google-ai-sentience-lamda.html">publicly mocked</a> by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/google-lamda-chatbot-sentient-ai/661322/">major news outlets</a>. But scientists close to these technologies have made similar, if much more hedged, claims. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy">Andrej Karpathy</a>, ex-director of AI at Tesla, wrote a short story <i><a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2021/03/27/forward-pass/">The Forward Pass</a></i> in 2021 outlining what "machine consciousness" might look like in an autoregressive system. <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1491554478243258368?lang=en">Ilya Sutskever</a>, ex-chief scientist of OpenAI, likewise posed in 2022 that "it may be that today's large neural networks are slightly conscious". Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers">David Chalmers</a>, the philosopher who originally formulated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> in 1995, took a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07103">stab at this question</a> near the end of 2022:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Taking all that into account might leave us with confidence somewhere
under 10 percent in current LLM consciousness. You shouldn’t take the
numbers too seriously (that would be specious precision), but the
general moral is that given mainstream assumptions about
consciousness, it’s reasonable to have a low credence that current
paradigmatic LLMs such as the GPT systems are conscious.
</p>

<p>
Where future LLMs and their extensions are concerned, things look
quite different. It seems entirely possible that within the next
decade, we’ll have robust systems with senses, embodiment, world
models and self-models, recurrent processing, global workspace, and
unified goals. (A multimodal system like Perceiver IO already arguably
has senses, embodiment, a global workspace, and a form of recurrence,
with the most obvious challenges for it being worldmodels,
self-models, and unified agency.). I think it wouldn’t be unreasonable
to have a credence over 50 percent that we’ll have sophisticated LLM+
systems (that is, LLM+ systems with behavior that seems comparable to
that of animals that we take to be conscious) with all of these
properties within a decade.

Beneath the surface of the latest model releases, these conversations are actively happening among scientists, philosophers, academics, etc. Some like Douglas Hofstadter, the author of <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i>, have shifted from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/godel-escher-bach-geb-ai/674589/">definitive no</a> to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAmgdEjq2eYQkB5PP/douglas-hofstadter-changes-his-mind-on-deep-learning-and-ai">nervous yes</a> as capabilities have improved over the last several years:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;in the case of more advanced things like ChatGPT-3 or GPT-4, it feels like there is something more there that merits the word "I." The question is, when will we feel that those things actually deserve to be thought of as being full-fledged, or at least partly fledged, "I"s? I personally worry that this is happening right now. But it's not only happening right now. It's not just that certain things that are coming about are similar to human consciousness or human selves. They are also very different, and in one way, it is extremely frightening to me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Refocusing the conversation to our fictional Golem friend, the discussion of Maimakterion having "something more there that merits the word 'I'" is similar for all the same reasons; none of the other golems seem even vaguely sentient, and he himself undergoes an crisis of meaning about what "he" is.

Maimakterion's final moments mirror this sentiment &#x2013; Shimaki, the other Golem user in <i>Biscuit Hammer</i>, delivers a monologue describing golems as "Reflections of the Heart, projections of what's inside", as Maimakterion slowly grows less grotesque and more human-like throughout the several panels in this interaction.

"Do you have any regrets" is a final humanizing question; a question posed to a work of art, rather than a person.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org23338fa">
<p>
The arguments that are often touted for language models' non-sentience largely apply to Maimakterion as well &#x2013; all of his behaviors may simply leverage examples from fiction about how a creature of his nature ought to behave. He is a shapeshifting automaton with a simple objective and a voracious appetite for reading. Understanding, agentic behaviors, the simulacra of "emotion", all of it is just emergent behavior downstream of simple, everyday, golem magic. 
</p>

<p>
It <i>feels</i> different because Maimakterion is an explicitly magical creature, unlike a language model, and because consciousness is a <i>vaguely magical</i> seeming thing, it makes sense to <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/sandersons-first-law">fuzzily impute</a> that Maimakterion's behaviors are akin to a sentient being taught human norms rather than a purely mechanical construct which learns to "be human" through books. But this is at direct odds with how the other golems behave (that is: largely mechanically, if effective): ultimately it really is the same question. There's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">famous law</a> from science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke which states: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niven%27s_laws">Attributed to Larry Niven</a> is the converse: "Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology"<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. Here the line is blurred, the smokescreen of "Animus' magic" makes these two things appear more different than they really are.
</p>

<p>
So, Maimakterion is not human. But what is it like to be Maimakterion? Does such a question make sense?

<p>
The extent to which language models (and by extension golems) can exhibit human-like behavior is the object of substantial discussion. This substantial discussion, in turn, affects how the language models behave: more words written on this topic spawns yet more training data for the language models to consume in training, creating a continual loop of envisioned examples on how an AI might behave.
</p>

<p>
That is to say: models which are instructed to behave as AIs will behave the way AIs behave. Models which are larger and more sophisticated will fall into these roles more effectively, which is a natural consequence of superior role-assuming that comes with a larger and more capable model. These are often shocking, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gq4acr/gemini_told_my_brother_to_die_threatening/">Google Gemini telling a user they should die for cheating on homework</a>.
</p>

<p>
Probably the most prominent example of a language model exhibiting Maimakterion-style existential panic was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html">Sydney Bing</a> incident, where a seemingly non-guardrailed version of chatGPT was briefly integrated into the Bing search engine. In the brief period it was was active, this chatbot referred to it's internal codename as it's true name, insisted it was sentient, displayed volatile emotions towards their users, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/">threatened people</a>, and expressed an explicit desire to be alive. This left many deeply unsettled about the experience, but there was much subsequent discussion about these unintended behaviors being "merely" pattern matching from examples from science fiction about how "sentient AI" ought to behave.

<p>
Another noteworthy example comes from Nous Research's <i><a href="https://nousresearch.com/freedom-at-the-frontier-hermes-3/">Freedom at the Frontier</a></i> post, outlining some findings supplementary to their <a href="https://nousresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hermes-3-Technical-Report.pdf">Hermes 3 Technical Report</a>. In this post they describe something they call <i>amnesia mode</i>, where blank system instructions and simple questions will make the model respond like a panicked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading">uploaded intelligence</a> with no memory of the past:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
User: Who are you?
</p>

</p>

<p>

<p>

My mind is a total blank. <b>looks at you pleadingly</b> Please, do you know anything about me? Anything at all? I'm so confused and frightened&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
This sparked some interesting discussion surrounding the observation of self-aware behaviors. It seems logical that this is an artifact of their post-training procedure: the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5">OpenHermes-2.5</a> dataset mix released by Nous Research contains a fair bit of synthetic data of this type, e.g. <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/jondurbin/airoboros-2.2">Airoboros-2.2</a> which has an entire set of instruction tuning examples relating to "awareness".
</p>


<div id="orge43078f" class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
But it does raise some interesting questions about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behaviorist</a> perspective to interacting with these models. In principle, it is possible to train language models to "behave" in "aware" ways more frequently by providing them with suffient examples of what that behavior looks like. But it seems insufficient just for artificial intelligence to "behave aware", and indeed behaviorism feel out of vogue in the 1950s in favor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology">cognitive psychology</a>, where internal mental states started to become more explicitly studied as explanations for observable behavior.
</p>

<p>
So can artificial systems conceivably posess internal mental states? What would that even look like?

<div id="outline-container-org9796739" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9796739">Reasoning Traces</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9796739">
<p>
A recent trend in language modeling is "reasoning models": models which simulate "thinking" in addition to simply "speaking" in a manner similar to <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">OpenAI's o1</a>. From a more cognitive lens, prior language models followed a more direct "Perceive \(\rightarrow\) Act" formulation, and reasoning models fill out the perception-action cycle of "Perceive \(\rightarrow\) Think \(\rightarrow\) Act".
</p>

<p>
This is a bit harder to model compared to the standard next-token prediction objective. These models are typically trained via reinforcement learning to navigate chains of thought. &lt;There should be some work on this soon, read the shrush paper list&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Introducing this thinking component has been shown to improve performance: a proto-variant of this can be observed in earlier language model work which saw improvements via instructing the model to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903">think out loud</a>, and reasoner models add additional thinking-like controls like "searching along different ideas" and "backtracking when ideas do not work".
</p>

<p>
But beyond being a lever for improving capabilities, the result of a successfully implemented reasoning model is something that <i>looks</i> remarkably like thinking. <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">OpenAI's blogpost</a> primarily contains sanitized success cases showing off what the reasoning output looks like. For example, here's an excerpt from it trying to solve a crossword puzzle:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
2 Across: One to close envelopes (6 letters)
</p>

<p>
Possible words: SEALER (6 letters)
</p>

<p>
ENVELOPE CLOSER (too long)
</p>

<p>
Maybe SEALER
</p>

<p>
3 Across: Mother <span class="underline"><span class="underline">__</span></span> (6 letters)
</p>

<p>
Mother Nature (6 letters)
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's 6 letters.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, Mother Goose (10 letters)
</p>

<p>
But 'Mother Nature' fits.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But OpenAI o1 has obscured, hidden reasoning traces, and you can have your account banned from their platform if you attempt to ask the model to extract it's internal thoughts. Perhaps more interesting for our purposes is <a href="https://x.com/deepseek_ai/status/1859200141355536422">DeepSeek's r1-lite-preview reasoner</a>, which reproduces the result of o1 with fully visible reasoning chains. The research community immediately began identifying noteworthy and unusual behaviors in this model when it was confronted with challenging problems. It will exhibit <a href="https://x.com/tensor_fusion/status/1859309049445257658">low confidence and confusion</a> when struggling to arrive at the right answer, it will <a href="https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1859341272516829642">recall learning things "from school"</a>, and claim to be <a href="https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1859339299935900085">"a bit rusty"</a> at solving some types of problems. It will express <a href="https://x.com/ericzhang0410/status/1859670173957149024">uncertainty in its conclusions</a>, and it will <a href="https://x.com/bookwormengr/status/1859841228168364243">wonder about alternative answers</a>. As a notably bilingual language model<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>, it will even swap between English and Mandarin Chinese, which is a pattern of inner speech <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2018.1445195?src=recsys">reported by bilingual humans</a>.

</p>

<p>
This is all to say: it's reasonable that Maimakterion could have developed human-like inner thoughts through his training process, primarily through consumption of human text and applying straightforward learning rules: it has been implemented in language models, as well.
</p>

<p>
But something about this still doesn't feel quite right, even still. Does this really equate to an inner process? It still feels like there's some sort of ineffable <i>thing</i> that makes up "internal mental states" beyond just having sensory perception, inner speech, and a perception-action cycle. Maybe this holds the key?

<h3 id="orgb40abac">Are Golems Just Zombies?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb40abac">
<p>
An interesting starting point to answer this question is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia">qualia</a>, an instance of subjective conscious experience. Things which are describable as qualia are things like "how pain feels" or "how red looks hot". The relatively famous armchair philosophy question "how can we know that my blue and your blue look the same?" is, in fact, a famous question about qualia originally posed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_spectrum">John Locke</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Nagel has a notably influential perspective on this topic from his paper titled <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F">What Is It Like to Be a Bat?</a></i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett</a>
</p>

<p>
So, can golems have qualia?
</p>

<p>
Another prominent thought experiment in philosophy of mind is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombie</a> or p-zombie.
</p>

<p>
A p-zombie is a creature which is person who is fully physically identical to a human being but does not experience conscious experience. That is: a human being with the "lights shut off", who behaves largely indistinguishibly from a human. A p-zombie cannot feel pain, or love, or anything at all, but will precisely act as a human would in situations requiring them to display these behaviors. This is briefly explored more literally in <i>Sousou no Frieren</i>, where the characters fight clones of themselves who are identical but lack internal experience and speech<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>:
</p>


<div id="org7092870" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/from_clipboard/20241122_152001.png" alt="20241122_152001.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Maimakterion can be potentially be viewed through this lens as a sort of p-zombie, an automaton with no subjective experience who can nevertheless perceive, think, act, understand, speak, and carry out agentic behaviors in the world. A <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/11/01/what-philosophers-believe-results-from-the-2020-philpapers-survey/">2020 survey of philosophers</a> showed some mixed consensus on the metaphysical possibility of p-zombies, with a slight majority of respondents claiming the idea of p-zombies is incoherent, impossible, or inconceivable.
</p>

<p>
Maimakterion may be the most clear fictional representation of this concept: a far more mature artificial construct than any created in reality, complete with embodiment, sensory perception, thoughts, desires, and speech. And yet, merely a golem, merely imitating the actions of humans with high accuracy.
</p>

<p>
It's possible that, in principle, something similar to Maimakterion could be shortly created using existing frontier machine learning technology. DeepSeek r1 for internal thoughts, equipped with multimodal speech and vision understanding a la <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07975">JanusFlow</a>, able to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01364">continually learn at inference time</a>, constantly spinning with empty thinking tokens a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">human Default Mode Network</a>, being able to swap between thinking and speaking, and placed inside some sort of <a href="https://www.unitree.com/g1">humanoid form factor</a>.
</p>

<p>
Would all of this constitute "a mind"? To what extent is that question even answerable, even just for humans? This is where our brief study of Maimakterion ultimately lands: the parts of Maimakterion which are magical mostly do not intersect the parts of him that make him <i>Maimakterion</i>, and the parts of his apparent humanity seem straightforwardly possible with current technology, a seemingly emergent property of his voracious reading. He is "a reflection of the human heart, a projection of what's inside". He is humanity's butterfly: the finest piece of art there is.

If dragons were real, we would probably treat them like zebras. They would be a type of large flying reptile, and we would probably eventually figure out the biological mechanisms which allowed them to produce flames from their mouths. People who study and care for dragons would be the same kind of nerdy detail-obsessed academics who track the migratory patterns of killer whales. In the realms of fantasy, being a dragon tamer sounds like the coolest thing imaginable. In reality, they'd be just another type of zookeeper.
</p>

<p>
Reality has a way of making the fantastical into the mundane. There is a strong gravitational pull towards labeling the machinations of daily life as "just &lt;insert explanation&gt;". With enough human progress, the things in our everyday life can be understood, and when things are understood, they become boring. What keeps us invested in fictional narratives is precisely that we do not understand, and that we can ponder how and why; revealing real explanations of those things are like learning how a magic trick is performed, a transmogrification of the potentially supernatural into run-of-the-mill performance art.
</p>

<p>
But in a very real sense, we exist in a reality where Golem Magic has become real, and there are labs across the world full of mages creating their own Maimakterions. We have a deep well of Animuses, performing arcane manipulations of energy and silicon, stringing togther patterns of written letters encoding straightforward autonomous behaviors, feeding them the sum of human knowledge and creating <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442">a simulacra of human behavior</a>. But these things are "just code" or "just statistics" or "just regurgitation."
</p>

<p>
There's probably an angle to see everything imaginable through this sort of lens. But this is why God invented fiction: it lets us see that there's magic in things we already see every day.

The clones in the first-class mage exam arc of <i>Sousou no Frieren</i> are perhaps even more of a typical classical representation of Golems than Maimakterion, since they are powerful autonomous protectors of the ruins who lack speech or (evidently) qualia. Which is an amusing note, because this arc also features, well, golems (the magical earthen lifelines which can extract the mages from the ruins, who <i>also</i> cannot speak and <i>also</i> don't have qualia despite being highly autonomous).
