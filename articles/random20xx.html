Putting this at the very top to hopefully increase engagement: this is
extremely imperfect and there are a few potential improvements that
could be done to make it better. Here are a few of those potential
improvements, and if you know of a solution to them please get in
contact with me so that I can update this and have it be a better
resource.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Wii U mode Gamecube Controller inputs to trigger actions in
autohotkey

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>right now I've been using two solutions, both sort of clunky - you
can press a key on your keyboard to randomly switch between
replays, or you can randomly switch between replays every X
seconds. Ideally you would just press D-Pad Left and get a random
dolphin savestate, but I don't know how to do this using Wii U
mode since Windows doesn't seem to detect it as a joystick and I'm
admittedly kind of an autohotkey noob.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Using FasterMelee with similar input lag compared to console, without
using Netplay Lobby

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The standard solution to artificially inserting lag frames in
FasterMelee (since it has less input lag than console) is to enter
a netplay lobby by yourself and crank buffer up. This is fine,
except for the fact that savestates are disabled in the netplay
lobby, rendering this useless. If you know of a workaround for
this (or, potentially, if you're on the FM team and would consider
adding a super-hidden "enable savestates in netplay" option),
please get in contact with me.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-usefulpractice" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="usefulpractice">Useful Practice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-usefulpractice">
<p>
4.06/4.07 is likely the most important non-sentient tool you have to
work on specific scenarios in your game, and doing this in Dolphin will
allow you greater control over your savestate workflow which will save
you time and greatly streamline your practice sessions.
</p>

<p>
A big problem you'll frequently run into doing 4.06 practice on console
is the limitation that comes with only being able to do one replay at a
time. This means that every time you turn the console off you need to
redo the entire replay, and every time you switch up what you're
practicing your old replay is lost. This is an enormous timesink,
especially if you spend a lot of time crafting a really detailed replay,
practice a single situation for maybe a half hour or so, and then
replace it with something completely different.
</p>

<p>
The solution here is to use dolphin savestates - you can make your
replay, save a state in dolphin with the replay running, make another
replay, save a <i>different</i> state with <i>that</i> replay running, so on and
so forth until you have up to ten concurrent replays in different
savestate slots. You can preserve the replays forever this way, since
they get stored as GALE01.sxx (where xx is the number slot it is, from
01 to 10). Savestates are around 17MB each, which is fairly large but
you can still build yourself a pretty sizable collection assuming you
have the hard drive space for it (for comparison, 880 savestates is
about the same size as Overwatch).
</p>

<p>
Another nice thing about this is that you can practice mixup situations
this way, using a simple randomized autohotkey script. So if you have
the same situation with 7 different variations (e.g. the same recovery
with 7 firefox angles) then you can practice reacting to the angle,
timing your input, and edgeguarding.
</p>

<p>
You can build up a database of drillable situations and copy-paste
replays into the root StateSaves directory (and re-rename it to
GALE01.sxx of course) which saves you plenty of time and increases the
longevity of your replays. You can now focus on making your replays as
detailed as possible and get accurate practice on that situation
forever, instead of rushing through it just to stay vaguely sharp at it.

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-workflow">
<p>
Steamlining this process is pretty straightforward, but requires you to
learn a workflow that might be a bit complicated at first. This also
assumes you're comfortable making replays normally in 20XX, so if you're
not then you should
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu-bIFnbffA8qmGlJmzqtD0Tnpj1xnLxf">watch
these</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-preppingreplays" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="preppingreplays">Prepping replays</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-preppingreplays">
<p>
First, you'll want to turn off in-game music. The last thing you want is
to associate a certain timing with a specific part of the dreamland
theme, instead of actually practicing reacting to specific mixups - just
practice with your own music in the background. You can use the "Game
Music OFF" Gecko code, but keep in mind that any replays you make
without this code don't super play nice when you enable this. You'll
also want to turn off stuff like rainbow FD, or just things that would
tip you off which replay was which before you had a practicable cue to
do so.
</p>

<p>
Next, you'll want to create your replay scenario up until the "branch
point". To truly create good mixup replays, you'll want the first parts
of each replay to be completely identical - I usually create a replay
with a single setup leading up to it (i.e. both characters spotdodge)
and then make multiple savestates on the frame where you want the
replays to become different.
</p>


<div id="orgc3464ef" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/ahk20xx/start_01_splitpoint.png" alt="start_01_splitpoint.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Then, for each alternate path, do the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>complete the replay</li>
<li>switch opponent to "Playback"</li>
<li>make your controller control yourself, another controller control
your opponent</li>
<li>load the replay + save over the "branching path" savestate</li>
</ul>


<div id="orgd9f19dd" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/ahk20xx/start_02_save.png" alt="start_02_save.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is a bit much to get through text so here's a short video in which
I create a few replays to practice reacting to shffl nair in the fox
ditto in order to trade with upsmash. (note: forgot to turn off rainbow
FD, whoops). Making 5 replays this way took 9 minutes and that's even
with me completely botching one and having to redo it, so it's pretty
quick once you get the hang of it.
</p>

<p>
To be used in dolphin, you need to have the savestates in your dolphin
directory in /dolphin/User/StateSaves, saved as GALE01.sxx - you can
rename savestates that are in s01 format to, say, s10 with no issue. So,
once you make your savestates, you can copy these files somewhere and
rename them, and using them again is just a matter of recopying them
back to the <i>StateSaves</i> root.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I've started building a small database of replays to use
whenever I want to practice something specific.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-scripting" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="scripting">Scripting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-scripting">
<p>
First and foremost, you'll want to download
<a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>. What this program does is allow
you to create basic macros for your computer - map a certain button
combination to a button, randomly select between keypresses, move files
around your computer, the whole shebang. We're going to learn to write
scripts to randomly swap between replays, which will let us practice a
replay without 100% knowing which replay we are practicing. The random
switching between them roughly emulates the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IoMUGFE46U">function of the
programmable dummy in training mode of other fighting games</a>, which is
a pretty useful feature to have.
</p>

<p>
Your basic building blocks are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Loop, {}</li>
<li>random, key, 1, 4 (you can replace with whatever numbers)</li>
<li>Send { %key% down } / Send { %key% up }</li>
<li>Sleep xxxx (replace xxxx with some number)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The level of difficulty of this script is about as basic as you could
want - the only annoying stipulations are that you need to explicitly
tell ahk to <i>hold</i> the key down for a short while since sometimes just
sending the number will not trigger the replay.
</p>

<p>
An example of a script with three replays would be the following
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ambisinister/db13662c2b03df2b1b06d48b6da08364.js"></script>

<p>
You also might want to manage your savestates automatically instead of
manually copying and pasting them to the StateSaves folder. This, too,
is pretty trivial in ahk. You can even try automating a practice
routine, which is a little tedious to configure (you need to manually
figure out times for each replay, or press a key on your keyboard to
advance to the next replay) but an example of that might look like this
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-potential" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="potential">Potential</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-potential">
<p>
If this gets fleshed out or streamlined, it could be a noticeable
improvement to how you go about practicing certain situations. While
it's already possible to practice reacting to certain things using 4.06
(techchasing comes to mind), being able to arbitrarily map out a
decision tree and randomly select between them lends a great deal of
extra power to practicing with replays.
</p>

<p>
If any noticable improvements to this idea are made, I'll update this
document with them. As I mentioned earlier, if you have a solution to
the input lag / WiiU-GCC-Adapter -&gt; AHK interfacing, <i>please</i> don't
hesitate to get in contact with me.
