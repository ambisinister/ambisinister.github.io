			<h1>Hobbies</h1>

			<div>
				<h2>Chess</h2>
				<p>I am the former president of the Yale College Chess Club.</p>
				<p>I used to play pretty frequently in tournaments but not so much anymore. I tend towards gambit openings and sharp positions, since I learned this game by grinding chess tactics puzzles. I play Blackmar-Diemer Gambit as white and Icelandic/Portugese/Budapest gambit as black.</p>

				<h2>Japanese</h2>
				<p>I study Japanese in my spare time. My primary resources are <a href="http://ankisrs.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> for Vocabulary and Kanji, and Tae Kim for Grammar.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Video Games that aren't Melee</h2>
				<p>I like games that feel like mastering them is a rewarding process. Because of this I tend towards competitive multiplayer games or quantifiable single-player games.</p>
				<p>I played <a href = "http://osu.ppy.sh/u/6794926" target="_blank">osu!</a> pretty frequently, although I don't as much anymore because it's pretty tough on my hands. I'm a tablet player that primarily plays aim maps and I'm trying to eventually learn HDDT.</p>
				<p>I have a real soft spot for Earthbound, and I also really enjoyed Undertale.</p>

				<h2>Hobbies about Manual Dexterity</h2>
				<p>I've always been fascinated with speed and precision in dextrous tasks and as such have a bunch of little hobbies that come from this interest.</p>
				<img src="images/pspin.gif" alt="It's me!" />
				<p>I like penspinning, I'm not the most skilled at it but it looks cool and I think it's fun</p>
				<p>I like Juggling! I can't juggle very many objects at once, but I know a pretty reasonable amount of 3-ball patterns</p>
				<p>I occasionally do things with Dice Stacking, but I haven't recorded myself doing it since 7-8 years ago and I'm not in any shape to do so now. (You can watch a video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bDgO3_vRXQ" target="_blank">someone else</a> though!)</p>
				<p>I used to be really into Rubik's Cubes, and my personal best was 28 seconds. I used a variation of Fridrich F2L.</p>
